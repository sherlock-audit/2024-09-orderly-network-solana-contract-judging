# An attacker will cause users to receive fake tokens instead of USDC

### Summary

The missing check on the deposit token in `oapp_lz_receive` will cause users to receive fake tokens instead of USDC as an attacker will call `oapp_lz_receive` with their own message, clearing it from LayerZero's endpoint and sending fake tokens to the user.

### Root Cause

In [`oapp_lz_receive.rs:57`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-09-orderly-network-solana-contract/blob/main/solana-vault/packages/solana/contracts/programs/solana-vault/src/instructions/oapp_instr/oapp_lz_receive.rs#L57), the `oapp_lz_receive` function lacks a check on the deposit token, allowing attackers to send fake tokens instead of the intended token (USDC).

### Internal pre-conditions

None

### External pre-conditions

None

### Attack Path

1. **Attacker monitors** messages sent from the orderly chain intended for a user.
2. **Attacker calls** `oapp_lz_receive` with the message, specifying a fake deposit token.
3. **The attacker's call** clears the legitimate message from LayerZero's endpoint.
4. **User receives** fake tokens instead of the intended token (USDC) due to processing the lack of verification of the `deposit_token`.

### Impact

The users cannot receive the real USDC tokens and instead receive the intended tokens, resulting in a loss of the user's funds.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Add a verification step in `oapp_lz_receive` to ensure that the deposit token matches the legitimate token (which can be extracted from the `AllowedToken` account based on the `withdraw_params.token_hash`), preventing attackers from substituting fake tokens.
