# Missing `deposit_token` token check in `lz_receive`

### Summary

In the `lz_receive` instruction, the current implementation only verifies the validity of the LayerZero message but does not compare the `deposit_token` account provided by the user with the `token_hash` deserialized from the `withdraw_params` in the LayerZero message payload. Although the documentation states that only USDC is currently supported, if additional tokens are introduced in the future or if there are balances in other ATAs under the `VaultAuthority`, an attacker could exploit this issue to withdraw those tokens. If the value of these tokens exceeds that of USDC, the attacker could profit from the discrepancy.

### Root Cause

In https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-09-orderly-network-solana-contract/blob/main/solana-vault/packages/solana/contracts/programs/solana-vault/src/instructions/oapp_instr/oapp_lz_receive.rs#L111-L123. there is a missing check of whether `ctx.accounts.deposit_token` equals `withdraw_params.token_hash`

### Internal pre-conditions

There are multiple supported tokens or there are balances in other ATAs under the `VaultAuthority`

### External pre-conditions

None

### Attack Path

Attacker calls `lz_receive` with inconsistent `ctx.accounts.deposit_token` and `withdraw_params.token_hash`

### Impact

Attacker steal tokens from protocol vault

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Check if  `ctx.accounts.deposit_token` equals `withdraw_params.token_hash`
