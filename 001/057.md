# Attacker will steal tokens from users

### Summary

Underconstrained call will cause a loss of funds for users as the attacker will execute bridge calls with different data.

### Root Cause

In the `OAppLzReceive` struct any `user` and `user_deposit_wallet` can be passed with the only constraint that the `user_deposit_wallet` belongs to user ([see here](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-09-orderly-network-solana-contract/blob/main/solana-vault/packages/solana/contracts/programs/solana-vault/src/instructions/oapp_instr/oapp_lz_receive.rs#L33-L40)). There is no restriction on the user however.

### Internal pre-conditions

1. User must withdraw UDSC from Orderly Network to Solana
2. The message must be verified by Layer Zero

### External pre-conditions

None

### Attack Path

1. The attacker calls the `oapp_lz_receive` instruction with the correct data but specifies their account as the `user` instead of the expected receiver and their ATA as `user_deposit_wallet`.

### Impact

The users can lose all funds withdrawn from Orderly to Solana.

### PoC

None

### Mitigation

Consider verifying whether the `user` account supplied is the same account as the `receiver` in the withdraw message.
