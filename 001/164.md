# token accounts are not verified against token_hash

### Summary

In Solana vault's deposit and withdraw flows token accounts are not verified against token_hash, this makes it possible for an attacker to withdraw from or deposit to the vault any token but make it seem like its any other token. 

### Root Cause

In `oapp_lz_receive.rs` and `deposit.rs`, `deposit_token` account is not checked againts `token_hash` parameter, token accounts are not included in the message either.:

### Internal pre-conditions

_No response_

### External pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

1. Attacker calls deposit with usdc_hash, for token accounts attacker chooses some other token that is worth less than usdc, but for the protocol it will seem an amount of usdc was deposited to the vault.
2. After deposit process is done, withdrawal process can take place with the same parameters but this time specifying usdc accounts, attacker profits.
This attack path assumes some amount of usdc is already deposited to the vault.

### Impact

Loss of funds.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

`deposit_token` should be checked against the token_hash parameter.
