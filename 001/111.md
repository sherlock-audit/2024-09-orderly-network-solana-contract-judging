# Uninitialized Accounts Cause Reverts in `solana_vault::lz_receive`

### Summary
During withdrawals from the SolConnector to the Solana vault, the [`solana_vault::lz_receive`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-09-orderly-network-solana-contract/blob/a40ed80ce4a196bc81bfa6dfb749c19b92c623b0/solana-vault/packages/solana/contracts/programs/solana-vault/src/lib.rs#L69-L71) function could attempt to send tokens to an account that has not yet been initialized. If the account hasn't been set up beforehand, the transfer fails, causing a revert and thus preventing the user from receiving their tokens.

### Root Cause
During withdrawals from SolConnector to the Solana vault, when executing the message in the vault via a call to the [`solana_vault::lz_receive`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-09-orderly-network-solana-contract/blob/a40ed80ce4a196bc81bfa6dfb749c19b92c623b0/solana-vault/packages/solana/contracts/programs/solana-vault/src/lib.rs#L69-L71) function, `lz_receive` retrieves the associated user deposit account:
```rust
    #[account(
        mut,
        associated_token::mint = deposit_token,
        associated_token::authority = user
    )]
    pub user_deposit_wallet: Account<'info, TokenAccount>,
```
It then tries to send the deposit tokens to the user's associated account. The problem here is that if the account hasn't been initialized prior to this, the transfer fails and reverts the call, temporarily blocking all further executions if it is an `order_delivery`:
```rust
        if ctx.accounts.vault_authority.order_delivery {
            require!(
                params.nonce == ctx.accounts.vault_authority.inbound_nonce + 1,
                OAppError::InvalidInboundNonce
            );
        }
```

### Internal Preconditions
None

### External Preconditions
None

### Attack Path
None

### Impact
All withdrawals to accounts that haven't yet initialized an associated account for the deposit token will always fail, thereby blocking other withdrawal executions and making it impossible for the user to receive their tokens.

### Mitigation
Add the `associated_token_program` to the `OAppLzReceive` struct:
```rust
 pub associated_token_program: Program<'info, AssociatedToken>,
```
Then update [`user_deposit_wallet`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-09-orderly-network-solana-contract/blob/a40ed80ce4a196bc81bfa6dfb749c19b92c623b0/solana-vault/packages/solana/contracts/programs/solana-vault/src/instructions/oapp_instr/oapp_lz_receive.rs#L35-L40) to:
```rust
    #[account(
+        init_if_needed,
        payer = payer,
        associated_token::mint = deposit_token,
        associated_token::authority = user,
+        associated_token::token_program = token_program
    )]
    pub user_deposit_wallet: Account<'info, TokenAccount>,
```
