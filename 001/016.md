# Anyone can call `lz_receive()` in SolanaVault to steal the withdrawn funds from the intended recipient

### Summary

The withdrawn funds are sent to the provided [`user_deposit_wallet`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-09-orderly-network-solana-contract/blob/main/solana-vault/packages/solana/contracts/programs/solana-vault/src/instructions/oapp_instr/oapp_lz_receive.rs#L68), which is not validated, instead of sending to the intended receiver in the `withdraw_params`. This enables anyone to steal the withdrawn funds.

### Root Cause

There are no constraints on the [`user`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-09-orderly-network-solana-contract/blob/main/solana-vault/packages/solana/contracts/programs/solana-vault/src/instructions/oapp_instr/oapp_lz_receive.rs#L32-L40) account.

```rust
#[account()]
pub user: AccountInfo<'info>,

#[account(
    mut,
    associated_token::mint = deposit_token,
    associated_token::authority = user
)]
pub user_deposit_wallet: Account<'info, TokenAccount>,
```

This means any `user` account and its associated `user_deposit_wallet` account can be passed as the [recipient](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-09-orderly-network-solana-contract/blob/main/solana-vault/packages/solana/contracts/programs/solana-vault/src/instructions/oapp_instr/oapp_lz_receive.rs#L65-L73) of the withdrawn funds. 

```rust
    fn transfer_token_ctx(&self) -> CpiContext<'_, '_, '_, 'info, Transfer<'info>> {
        let cpi_accounts = Transfer {
            from: self.vault_deposit_wallet.to_account_info(),
            to: self.user_deposit_wallet.to_account_info(),
            authority: self.vault_authority.to_account_info(),
        };
        let cpi_program = self.token_program.to_account_info();
        CpiContext::new(cpi_program, cpi_accounts)
    }
```

### Internal pre-conditions

1. OApp Admin [sets the peer](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-09-orderly-network-solana-contract/blob/main/solana-vault/packages/solana/contracts/programs/solana-vault/src/instructions/oapp_instr/set_peer.rs#L29-L33) in Solana Vault for the Orderly EID as the `SolConnector`'s address.
2. OApp Admin calls [`init_nonce()`](https://github.com/LayerZero-Labs/LayerZero-v2/blob/main/packages/layerzero-v2/solana/programs/programs/endpoint/src/instructions/oapp/init_nonce.rs#L15-L26) in the Endpoint program to accept messages from `SolConnector` in Orderly L2.

This setup is needed so the Solana Vault program can receive LZ messages from `SolConnector` in Orderly L2.

### External pre-conditions

1. The DVNs verify a `withdrawal` message from the `SolConnector` in Orderly L2 with the required confirmations.

### Attack Path

1. Once **_any_** `withdrawal` message has been verified, the attacker or anyone can commit the verification by calling [`init_verify()`](https://github.com/LayerZero-Labs/LayerZero-v2/blob/main/packages/layerzero-v2/solana/programs/programs/endpoint/src/instructions/init_verify.rs#L37-L41) on the Endpoint program and [`commit_verification()`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-09-orderly-network-solana-contract/blob/main/solana-vault/packages/solana/contracts/programs/uln/src/instructions/commit_verification.rs#L14-L38) on the Send Library (the ULN302 program.)
2. The attacker front-runs the Executor in running [`lz_receive()`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-09-orderly-network-solana-contract/blob/main/solana-vault/packages/solana/contracts/programs/solana-vault/src/instructions/oapp_instr/oapp_lz_receive.rs#L75-L132) on the Solana Vault for target `withdrawal`. The attacker sets the `user` and `user_deposit_wallet` to point to his accounts.
3. The withdrawn funds will be sent to the attacker's `user_deposit_wallet`.

### Impact

`Solana Vault` will lose all of the withdrawn funds. All of the deposited funds in Solana Vault are at risk. This is a permanent loss of funds.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Consider verifying that the public key of the [`user`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-09-orderly-network-solana-contract/blob/main/solana-vault/packages/solana/contracts/programs/solana-vault/src/instructions/oapp_instr/oapp_lz_receive.rs#L33) account matches the [`receiver`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-09-orderly-network-solana-contract/blob/main/solana-vault/packages/solana/contracts/programs/solana-vault/src/instructions/oapp_instr/oapp_lz_receive.rs#L201) in the [`withdraw_params`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-09-orderly-network-solana-contract/blob/main/solana-vault/packages/solana/contracts/programs/solana-vault/src/instructions/oapp_instr/oapp_lz_receive.rs#L111).
