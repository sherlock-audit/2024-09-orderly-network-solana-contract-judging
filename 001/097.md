# Inadequate User Verification Allows Unauthorized Token Redirection

### Summary

A verified withdrawal message can be maliciously redirected to an attacker's account due to an inadequate user account check in `OAppLzReceive`, allowing funds intended for a legitimate receiver to be sent to an unauthorized user.


### Root Cause

When the ledger processes a withdrawal through the [`SolConnector::withdraw`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-09-orderly-network-solana-contract/blob/a40ed80ce4a196bc81bfa6dfb749c19b92c623b0/sol-cc/contracts/SolConnector.sol#L77-L98) function, the message is sent via LayerZero to the Orderly vault in Solana.  
In Solana, the message is verified by the [`endpoint::verify`](https://github.com/LayerZero-Labs/LayerZero-v2/blob/7bcfb4d5dac4192570af5e51dbc67413a6116a14/packages/layerzero-v2/solana/programs/programs/endpoint/src/lib.rs#L175-L177) function, and upon successful verification, the `PacketVerifiedEvent` is emitted, making the message executable.  
A malicious user listening to `PacketVerifiedEvent` for the oapp receiver can then deliver the message to [`solana_vault::lz_receive`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-09-orderly-network-solana-contract/blob/a40ed80ce4a196bc81bfa6dfb749c19b92c623b0/solana-vault/packages/solana/contracts/programs/solana-vault/src/lib.rs#L69-L71) with the message as verified in layerZero endpoint but with their account as the user instead of the receiver.

```rust
    #[account()]
    pub user: AccountInfo<'info>,
```

In the constructed withdrawal message in `SolConnector`, the intended receiver is defined here:

```solidity
// AccountTypes
struct AccountWithdrawSol {
    bytes32 accountId;
    bytes32 sender;
    bytes32 receiver;  //<-----  @
    bytes32 brokerHash;
    bytes32 tokenHash;
    uint128 tokenAmount;
    uint128 fee;
    uint256 chainId;
    uint64 withdrawNonce;
}
```

Due to missing constraint checks, the tokens are sent from the vault wallet to the user wallet instead:

```rust
    fn transfer_token_ctx(&self) -> CpiContext<'_, '_, '_, 'info, Transfer<'info>> {
        let cpi_accounts = Transfer {
            from: self.vault_deposit_wallet.to_account_info(),
            to: self.user_deposit_wallet.to_account_info(),
            authority: self.vault_authority.to_account_info(),
        };
        let cpi_program = self.token_program.to_account_info();
        CpiContext::new(cpi_program, cpi_accounts)
    }
```

### Attack Path

1. The ledger issues a cross-chain withdrawal to solana via [`SolConnector::withdraw`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-09-orderly-network-solana-contract/blob/a40ed80ce4a196bc81bfa6dfb749c19b92c623b0/sol-cc/contracts/SolConnector.sol#L77-L98) function 
2. After the message has been verified, the attacker calls [solana_vault::lz_receive](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-09-orderly-network-solana-contract/blob/a40ed80ce4a196bc81bfa6dfb749c19b92c623b0/solana-vault/packages/solana/contracts/programs/solana-vault/src/lib.rs#L69-L71) with the verified message, but with his account as the user account.

### Impact

During a withdrawal, tokens intended for the receiver are at risk of being hijacked and redirected to unauthorized user accounts.

### PoC

### Mitigation

Add a `get_receiver_address` function to `AccountWithdrawSol` to verify the intended recipient:

```rust 
    pub fn get_receiver_address(encoded: &[u8]) -> Result<Pubkey> {
        // Decode the LzMessage to get the payload
        let message = LzMessage::decode(encoded)?;

        // Decode the payload
        let withdraw_params = AccountWithdrawSol::decode_packed(&message.payload)?;

        // Return the receiver address as a Pubkey
        Ok(Pubkey::new_from_array(withdraw_params.receiver))
    }
```

Then update `OAppLzReceive::user` to:

```rust
    #[account(address = AccountWithdrawSol::get_receiver_address(&params.message)?)]
    pub user: AccountInfo<'info>,
```
