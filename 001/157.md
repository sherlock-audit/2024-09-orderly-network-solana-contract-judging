# User will be able to use any deposit_token to bridge usdc

### Summary

Missing constraint on `allowed_token` will cause users to be able to use any token mint account as `deposit_token` making users able to spoof depositing USDC by depositing any token.

### Root Cause

In [deposit.rs:89](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-09-orderly-network-solana-contract/blob/main/solana-vault/packages/solana/contracts/programs/solana-vault/src/instructions/vault_instr/deposit.rs#L84-L89) there is a missing constraint on `allowed_token` that would prevent any `deposit_token` to be used when calling `deposit`.

### Internal pre-conditions

Non needed

### External pre-conditions

Non needed

### Attack Path

1. User calls `deposit` with any `deposit_token` , which will trigger cross-chain service to send deposit
2. User starts withdrawal process (as pointed out by the team in Solana_Vault_Design.pdf)
3. USDC are send to the user, based on the `amount` of `deposit_token` he deposited in Step1

### Impact

The protocols suffers an approximate loss as high as the USDC that the `vault_token_account` has.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Include a constraint in `allowed_token` account that checks that the `deposit_token` is equal to `allowed_token.mint_account`.
