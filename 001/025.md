# Any token can be sent to the vault even if is not allowed

### Summary

The current implementation of the Deposit instruction in the Solana program does not enforce a check to validate that the token being deposited is allowed by the vault's configuration. This oversight could potentially allow unauthorized tokens to be deposited into the vault.

Relevant code 
```rust
#[account(
    seeds = [TOKEN_SEED, deposit_params.token_hash.as_ref()],
    bump = allowed_token.bump,
    constraint = allowed_token.allowed == true @ VaultError::TokenNotAllowed
)]
pub allowed_token: Box<Account<'info, AllowedToken>>;
```

### Root Cause


Missing input validations allows us to use any token

### Internal pre-conditions

Any token account 's allowed token where in the allowed_token's account the allowed is marked as the boolean true can be used.


### Impact

 The primary risk is that any token could potentially be deposited into the vault, regardless of whether it has been approved or not. This could include tokens that are not intended to be part of the vault's ecosystem, leading to potential misuse or exploitation of the vault's resources.

_No response_

### Mitigation

```diff
    #[account(
        seeds = [TOKEN_SEED, deposit_params.token_hash.as_ref()],
        bump = allowed_token.bump,
+       constraint = allowed_token.token_hash == deposit_params.token_hash && allowed_token.mint_account == deposit_token.key() && allowed_token.allowed == true @ VaultError::TokenNotAllowed
-       constraint = allowed_token.allowed == true @ VaultError::TokenNotAllowed
    )]
    ```
