# oapp_lz_receive is missing a user check.

### Summary

The oapp_lz_receive function is missing a user check, allowing malicious actors to execute cross-chain messages from Orderly Chain to transfer tokens to accounts they control.

### Root Cause

The function lacks a check for the receiver address of cross-chain messages.

```rust
    /// CHECK
    #[account()]
    pub user: AccountInfo<'info>,

    #[account(
        mut,
        associated_token::mint = deposit_token,
        associated_token::authority = user
    )]
    pub user_deposit_wallet: Account<'info, TokenAccount>,
```

### Internal pre-conditions

None

### External pre-conditions

None

### Attack Path

1. The user sends a cross-chain request from Orderly Chain to Solana.  
2. The malicious actor executes the user's cross-chain message on Solana, passing the user and user_deposit_wallet to an address they control.  
3. The USDC withdrawn by the user will be transferred to the malicious user's associated account.  

### Impact

The USDC withdrawn by the user through the cross-chain message may be stolen.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Add a user check
```diff
        let lz_message = LzMessage::decode(&params.message).unwrap();
        msg!("msg_type: {:?}", lz_message.msg_type);
+       ctx.accounts.user = lz_message.reveiver.toPublicKey();
```
