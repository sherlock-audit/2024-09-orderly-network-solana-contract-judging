# Attacker will steal other users' token

### Summary

In the `lz_receive` instruction, the current implementation only verifies the validity of the LayerZero message, but does not compare the `user` parameter provided by the caller with the `receiver` deserialized from the `withdraw_params` in the LayerZero message payload. This vulnerability allows an attacker to supply a LayerZero message intended for another user and potentially steal that userâ€™s tokens.

### Root Cause

In https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-09-orderly-network-solana-contract/blob/main/solana-vault/packages/solana/contracts/programs/solana-vault/src/instructions/oapp_instr/oapp_lz_receive.rs#L111-L123. there is a missing check of whether `ctx.accounts.user` equals `withdraw_params.receiver`

### Internal pre-conditions

- A normal user deposits some tokens and triggers a LayerZero message.

### External pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

Attacker calls `lz_receive` with another users' LayerZero message

### Impact

The user lose deposited tokens

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Check if `ctx.accounts.user` equals `withdraw_params.receiver`
