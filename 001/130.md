# Withdrawn USDC from `SolanaVault` can be replaced with any token

### Summary

There is no validation that the [`deposit_token`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-09-orderly-network-solana-contract/blob/main/solana-vault/packages/solana/contracts/programs/solana-vault/src/instructions/oapp_instr/oapp_lz_receive.rs#L56-L57) account is USDC or the `allowed_token` when running [`lz_receive()`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-09-orderly-network-solana-contract/blob/main/solana-vault/packages/solana/contracts/programs/solana-vault/src/instructions/oapp_instr/oapp_lz_receive.rs#L75-L133). Anyone that runs `lz_receive()` on the withdrawal message can use a worthless token for `deposit_token` so the recipient gets that worthless token instead of USDC.

### Root Cause

In [`oapp_lz_receive.rs::35-133`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-09-orderly-network-solana-contract/blob/main/solana-vault/packages/solana/contracts/programs/solana-vault/src/instructions/oapp_instr/oapp_lz_receive.rs#L35-L133), there is no validation that `deposit_token` is USDC or the [`allowed_token`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-09-orderly-network-solana-contract/blob/main/solana-vault/packages/solana/contracts/programs/solana-vault/src/instructions/vault_instr/set_token.rs#L33-L54).

### Internal pre-conditions

_No response_

### External pre-conditions

1. A user withdraws USDC from a source chain to Solana.

### Attack Path

1. The Attacker deploys a worthless token.
2. The Attacker then `deposits` the worthless token into SolanaVault so the [`vault_token_account`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-09-orderly-network-solana-contract/blob/main/solana-vault/packages/solana/contracts/programs/solana-vault/src/instructions/vault_instr/deposit.rs#L40-L46) is created.
3. Once the withdrawal message has been verified, the attacker executes it by calling [`lz_receive()`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-09-orderly-network-solana-contract/blob/main/solana-vault/packages/solana/contracts/programs/solana-vault/src/lib.rs#L69-L71) on SolanaVault with the appropriate `params` for the target message. Typically, the Executor does this but it is open to anyone.
4. The Attacker passes a worthless [`deposit_token`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-09-orderly-network-solana-contract/blob/main/solana-vault/packages/solana/contracts/programs/solana-vault/src/instructions/oapp_instr/oapp_lz_receive.rs#L56-L57) so the recipient receives the worthless token instead of USDC.

Note that is a different issue from the Attacker sending the tokens to themselves due to lacking validation on the [`user_deposit_wallet`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-09-orderly-network-solana-contract/blob/main/solana-vault/packages/solana/contracts/programs/solana-vault/src/instructions/oapp_instr/oapp_lz_receive.rs#L35-L40).

### Impact

The withdrawer loses all their USDC in place of worthless tokens. There is no cost to the attacker apart from gas. This is a permanent loss of funds.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Consider validating that the [`deposit_token`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-09-orderly-network-solana-contract/blob/main/solana-vault/packages/solana/contracts/programs/solana-vault/src/instructions/oapp_instr/oapp_lz_receive.rs#L56-L57) is the `allowed_token`.
