# An attacker will deposit fake tokens and withdraw USDC

### Summary

The missing check over the `deposit_token` mint account in the `deposit` instruction will cause a loss of real tokens for the protocol and legitimate users as an attacker will deposit fake tokens and withdraw real ones on the orderly chain.

### Root Cause

In [`deposit.rs:49`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-09-orderly-network-solana-contract/blob/main/solana-vault/packages/solana/contracts/programs/solana-vault/src/instructions/vault_instr/deposit.rs#L49), the `deposit` instruction lacks a check to verify that `deposit_token` is equal to `allowed_token.mint_account`, allowing deposits of arbitrary tokens.


### Internal pre-conditions

None

### External pre-conditions

None

### Attack Path

1. **Attacker creates** a fake token mint that they control, and mints the same amount of the total tokens in the orderly chain.
2. **Attacker calls** the `deposit` instruction, supplying their fake `deposit_token` mint account and depositing fake tokens.
3. **The program accepts** the deposit and relays it to the orderly chain as if it were the allowed token, based on the `deposit_params.token_hash` submitted.
4. **Attacker withdraws** real tokens (e.g., USDC) from the orderly chain, effectively exchanging worthless tokens for valuable ones and draining the contract.

### Impact

The protocol and legitimate users suffer a loss of real tokens (USDC), as attackers can deposit fake tokens and withdraw real ones, depleting the protocol's reserves.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Require that the address of the `deposit_token` is equal to the `allowed_token.mint_account` in the `deposit` instruction, ensuring only allowed tokens can be deposited.
