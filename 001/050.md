# An attacker will steal withdrawals from users

### Summary

Missing verification of `user_deposit_wallet` and `user` accounts in `OAppLzReceive` will cause a complete loss of funds for users as an attacker will call `lz_receive` with their own accounts to steal withdrawals.

### Root Cause

In [`oapp_lz_receive.rs:31-40`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-09-orderly-network-solana-contract/blob/main/solana-vault/packages/solana/contracts/programs/solana-vault/src/instructions/oapp_instr/oapp_lz_receive.rs#L31-L40), the `OAppLzReceive` instruction lacks verification over the `user_deposit_wallet` and `user` accounts, allowing attackers to input their own accounts and steal withdrawals.

### Internal pre-conditions

None

### External pre-conditions

None

### Attack Path

1. A user initiates a withdrawal on the orderly chain.
2. The message is relayed to the solana chain via Layer Zero messaging protocol.
3. Any attacker calls `lz_receive` with their accounts as the `user` and their associated token account as `user_deposit_wallet`.

### Impact

The withdrawer loses his funds while relayed to the solana chain.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Consider requiring the address of the `user` to be identical to `withdraw_params.receiver`.
