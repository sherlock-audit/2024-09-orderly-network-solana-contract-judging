# [H-1] - User can deposit unauthorized tokens, leading to incorrect crediting of USDC on the other chain.

### Summary

There are no checks to ensure that the `deposit_token` matches the `allowed_token` in the `solana_vault::deposit` function. This allows an attacker to deposit any tokens and get minted USDC on the other chain. The system assumes that an allowed token is deposited every time and this assumption is wrong.

### Root Cause

In [deposit.rs](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-09-orderly-network-solana-contract/blob/main/solana-vault/packages/solana/contracts/programs/solana-vault/src/instructions/vault_instr/deposit.rs#L22), the `Deposit` struct lacks a constraint to verify that `deposit_token.key()` matches the `allowed_token.mint_account`.

This check could also be added inside the `solana_vault::deposit` or the `deposit.rs::apply` functions directly, but currently, none of these functions have this check either.

`deposit_params.token_hash` is a user-controlled input param provided by the user when they call the `solana_vault::deposit` function. It is intended to represent the hash of the token the user is depositing. The problem is that there is no enforced relationship with `deposit_token`. There is no constraint that enforces that `deposit_params.token_hash` corresponds to the actual `deposit_token` mint provided in the accounts.

### Internal pre-conditions

1. The `allowed_token` account is configured to accept a specific token (USDC) with `allowed_token.allowed == true`.
2. The `allowed_token.mint_account` is set to the mint address of the allowed token (USDC).
3. The vault is initialized and operational, expecting deposits of the allowed token.

### External pre-conditions

1. The attacker possesses another token, e.g., WIF or another memecoin.
2. The attacker has a token account associated with this memecoin and owns, let's say 10.000 tokens which are worth 1$. Assume a price/coin of 0.0001$.
3. The attacker knows the `token_hash` corresponding to the allowed token (USDC).

### Attack Path

The attacker calls the deposit Function and provides:
- `WIF` as `deposit_token`
-  with an amount of `10.000` 
-  `deposit_params.token_hash` that corresponds to USDC token_hash
- includes the `allowed_token` that the Vault is configured to accept (USDC).

Program Execution:

- The function `deposit.rs::transfer_token_ctx` transfers the tokens from the attacker's `user_token_account` to the vault's `vault_token_account`.
- Due to the missing constraint, the program does not verify that `deposit_token.key()` matches `allowed_token.mint_account`.
- The `deposit.rs::apply` function increments `vault_authority.deposit_nonce` by 1.
- After that, the `apply` function creates the `VaultDepositParams` object, setting `token_hash` to be equal to whatever `token_hash` the user provided inside the `DepositParams` struct.
- The program records the deposit as if the allowed token (USDC) was deposited.
- It sends a message to the other chain indicating that the allowed token was deposited.


Resulting Impact:

- On the other chain, the attacker is credited with USDC equivalent to the amount of tokens deposited (10.000 USDC).
- The vault holds the WIF tokens, which are worth 1$ (for the sake of this example). The attacker can even create a random coin with no value and make the deposit.


### Impact

For the Protocol:

- The protocol suffers a financial loss equivalent to the amount of USDC incorrectly credited to the attacker on the other chain.
- The vault ends up holding unauthorized tokens instead of the intended allowed tokens.


For the Attacker:

- The attacker gains USDC on the other chain without depositing the equivalent value of the allowed token.
- The attacker can drain the vault.


### PoC

Not necessary. Check the `solana-vault/packages/solana/contracts/programs/solana-vault/src/instructions/vault_instr/deposit.rs::Deposit` struct definition [here](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-09-orderly-network-solana-contract/blob/main/solana-vault/packages/solana/contracts/programs/solana-vault/src/instructions/vault_instr/deposit.rs#L22). There are no checks that enforce `deposit_token == allowed_token`. 

You can also check the Solana Vault deposit function implementation `solana-vault/packages/solana/contracts/programs/solana-vault/src/lib.rs::deposit` [here](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-09-orderly-network-solana-contract/blob/main/solana-vault/packages/solana/contracts/programs/solana-vault/src/lib.rs#L22) and see that it doesn't have this check, nor does the `solana-vault/packages/solana/contracts/programs/solana-vault/src/instructions/vault_instr/deposit.rs::apply` function -- check it [here](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-09-orderly-network-solana-contract/blob/main/solana-vault/packages/solana/contracts/programs/solana-vault/src/instructions/vault_instr/deposit.rs#L107).

### Mitigation

Add a new `constraint` in `deposit.rs::Deposit` struct.

Update the `deposit_token` account definition in `deposit.rs` to include a `constraint` that ensures the `deposit_token` mint matches the `allowed_token.mint_account`.


```rust
#[account(
    constraint = deposit_token.key() == allowed_token.mint_account @ VaultError::InvalidDepositToken
)]
```
