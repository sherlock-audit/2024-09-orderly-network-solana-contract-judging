# lz_receive can be called with any user account to steal from users

### Summary

OApp's `lz_receive` instruction is freely callable by anyone once the message gets verified. As user account in this instruction is not verified or included in the message, any user account can be specified for the instruction and the message would still go through, thus enabling withdrawal to any account.

### Root Cause

In `oapp_lz_receive.rs` lack of checks for user accounts that the tokens will be sent to
