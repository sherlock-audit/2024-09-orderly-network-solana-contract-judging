# User can deposit any token in `SolanaVault` and get USDC in `SolConnector`

### Summary

Any [`deposit_token`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-09-orderly-network-solana-contract/blob/main/solana-vault/packages/solana/contracts/programs/solana-vault/src/instructions/vault_instr/deposit.rs#L26-L49) can be used when depositing into SolanaVault. There are no validations that check that the deposit token matches the [allowed token](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-09-orderly-network-solana-contract/blob/main/solana-vault/packages/solana/contracts/programs/solana-vault/src/instructions/vault_instr/deposit.rs#L84-L89). This can be abused by depositing tokens that have higher precision or are priced lower than USDC for profit at the expense of Orderly.

### Root Cause

In [`deposit.rs:33-167`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-09-orderly-network-solana-contract/blob/main/solana-vault/packages/solana/contracts/programs/solana-vault/src/instructions/vault_instr/deposit.rs#L33-L167), there are no validations that prevent the use of a [deposit token](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-09-orderly-network-solana-contract/blob/main/solana-vault/packages/solana/contracts/programs/solana-vault/src/instructions/vault_instr/deposit.rs#L48-L49) other than the [allowed token](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-09-orderly-network-solana-contract/blob/main/solana-vault/packages/solana/contracts/programs/solana-vault/src/instructions/vault_instr/deposit.rs#L84-L89).

### Internal pre-conditions

The Admin has set up sending and receiving USDC from Solana.
1. Admi has [set the allowed chain token](https://github.com/OrderlyNetwork/contract-evm/blob/main/src/VaultManager.sol#L119-L122) in VaultManager as USDC for Solana.

### External pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

1. Anyone calls `deposit()` in SolanaVault passing a worthless token as [deposit token](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-09-orderly-network-solana-contract/blob/main/solana-vault/packages/solana/contracts/programs/solana-vault/src/instructions/vault_instr/deposit.rs#L48-L49). This worthless token can be a token the Attacker deployed.
3. The `vault_token_account` passed will be initialized even if it does not exist because of the [`init_if_needed`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-09-orderly-network-solana-contract/blob/main/solana-vault/packages/solana/contracts/programs/solana-vault/src/instructions/vault_instr/deposit.rs#L40-L46) constraint.
4. The tokens are [transferred](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-09-orderly-network-solana-contract/blob/main/solana-vault/packages/solana/contracts/programs/solana-vault/src/instructions/vault_instr/deposit.rs#L98-L104) from the user's token account to the Vault's just-initialized token account.
5. The LayerZero VaultDeposit message is [sent](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-09-orderly-network-solana-contract/blob/main/solana-vault/packages/solana/contracts/programs/solana-vault/src/instructions/vault_instr/deposit.rs#L152-L158).
6. In Orderly, `SolConnector` receives the messages and [records the deposit](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-09-orderly-network-solana-contract/blob/main/sol-cc/contracts/SolConnector.sol#L69) in the Ledger. 
7. The deposit is [recorded](https://github.com/OrderlyNetwork/contract-evm/blob/main/src/LedgerImplA.sol#L51-L52) since it passes all the [validations](https://github.com/OrderlyNetwork/contract-evm/blob/main/src/LedgerImplA.sol#L36-L40) in the Ledger.
8. After the deposit is recorded in Orderly, the attacker can withdraw their USDC to any network they prefer.

### Impact

The protocol can lose all the USDC it holds for worthless tokens. It is a permanent loss of funds.

### PoC

Copy [diff](https://gist.github.com/gjaldon/972b76e37e6de09c8b4552d5661dc7bc) into a file and the `git apply file.diff` from the repo's root. 

Run `anchor test` and it will succeed. The modifications are to the `"deposits"` test and show that even if the `allowed_token` is not USDC, the user can use USDC (or any other token) to deposit. It also shows that the `vault_token_account` will be initialized when it does not exist. This is partly why the attack is possible.

### Mitigation

Consider adding a validation in `deposit()` that ensures that the [`deposit_token`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-09-orderly-network-solana-contract/blob/main/solana-vault/packages/solana/contracts/programs/solana-vault/src/instructions/vault_instr/deposit.rs#L48-L49) matches the [`allowed_token.mint_account`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-09-orderly-network-solana-contract/blob/main/solana-vault/packages/solana/contracts/programs/solana-vault/src/state/vault_state/allowed_token.rs#L6).
