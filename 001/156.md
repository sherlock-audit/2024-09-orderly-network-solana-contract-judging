# Actor can frontrun lz_receive and steal users’ withdrawal

### Summary

Missing `receiver` check will cause the `lz_receive` to be frontrunnable as malicious actors will be able to call it with any `user_deposit_wallet`.

### Root Cause

In [oapp_lz_receive:111](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-09-orderly-network-solana-contract/blob/main/solana-vault/packages/solana/contracts/programs/solana-vault/src/instructions/oapp_instr/oapp_lz_receive.rs#L111-L123) there is a missing check of `receiver` and `user_deposit_wallet`'s authority, which allows `lz_receive` to be called with a `user_deposit_wallet` that doesn't belong to the `receiver`.

### Internal pre-conditions

Non needed

### External pre-conditions

1. The PDA `payload_hash` of layerzero’s endpoint has to be set, in order for the following `require` statement to pass.
```rust
require!(
    payload_hash == ctx.accounts.payload_hash.hash,
    LayerZeroError::PayloadHashNotFound
);
```
2. It has to frontrun a legitimate call to `lz_receive`

### Attack Path

1. Legitimate user initiates the withdrawal process
2. Attacker frontruns the call to `lz_receive` with the same `params` and `accounts` except the `user_deposit_wallet` which will be the attacker’s token account.

### Impact

The user which initiated the withdrawal process suffers a loss equal to the withdrawal amount requested.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Add a check that the `user_deposit_wallet`’s authority is equal to the `receiver`.
