# The account OAppLzReceive::user_deposit_wallet may not be initialized, leading to withdraw failure on the Solana side.

### Summary

The account OAppLzReceive::user_deposit_wallet may not be initialized, leading to withdraw failure on the Solana side.

### Root Cause

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-09-orderly-network-solana-contract/blob/main/solana-vault/packages/solana/contracts/programs/solana-vault/src/instructions/oapp_instr/oapp_lz_receive.rs#L13
```rust
pub struct OAppLzReceive<'info> {
    #[account(mut)]
    pub payer: Signer<'info>,
    #[account(
        seeds = [
            PEER_SEED,
            &oapp_config.key().to_bytes(),
            &params.src_eid.to_be_bytes()
        ],
        bump = peer.bump,
        constraint = peer.address == params.sender @OAppError::InvalidSender
    )]
    pub peer: Account<'info, Peer>,
    #[account(
        seeds = [OAPP_SEED],
        bump = oapp_config.bump
    )]
    pub oapp_config: Account<'info, OAppConfig>,
    /// CHECK
    #[account()]
@>    pub user: AccountInfo<'info>,

    #[account(
@>        mut,
        associated_token::mint = deposit_token,
        associated_token::authority = user
    )]
@>    pub user_deposit_wallet: Account<'info, TokenAccount>,
    //----skip
}
```
user_deposit_wallet is a PDA (Program Derived Address) account, and on the Solana blockchain, each newly created account must be initialized first. Account initialization typically involves allocating space and funds for the account, allowing it to store data and participate in transactions on-chain. If user_deposit_wallet is not initialized, the lz_receive() function will fail to execute, resulting in a withdraw failure on the Solana side.

### Internal pre-conditions

_No response_

### External pre-conditions

When the user address at the time of withdraw is different from the address used during deposit, itâ€™s common in DeFi protocols for users to withdraw funds to another address due to specific needs (such as the private key of the original address being compromised or lost).

### Attack Path

_No response_

### Impact

User funds are stuck in the protocol.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

```diff
    #[account(
-       mut,
+       init_if_needed,
        associated_token::mint = deposit_token,
        associated_token::authority = user
    )]
    pub user_deposit_wallet: Account<'info, TokenAccount>,
