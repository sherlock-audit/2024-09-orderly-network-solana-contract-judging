# Excess fees are not sent back and stuck in SolConnector.sol

### Summary

When the user wants to withdraw funds from vault on Solana, he has to pay the fees for cross-chain service to transfer the withdrawal request to Solana through the Layer Zero cross-chain infrastructure. In case of failed source message, or if after paying fees remained unused amount of native currency or `lzToken`, user expects the amount to be refunded. 
But current refunding mechanism is wrong and causes the fees to be stuck without the possibility of withdrawing them or returning them back to the user.

### Root Cause

[Link 1](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-09-orderly-network-solana-contract/blob/a40ed80ce4a196bc81bfa6dfb749c19b92c623b0/sol-cc/contracts/SolConnector.sol#L97)
In `SolConnector.withdraw()` `refundAddress` is specified as `address(this)`, in this case `address(this)` is the `SolConnector.sol`, not the user that initiated the transaction. All excess fees Endpoint will send to `SolConnector.sol`. Moreover, in `SolConnector.sol` there is no function that can use the fees or extract them.
```solidity
_lzSend(solEid, lzWithdrawMsg, withdrawOptions, _msgFee, address(this));

 function _lzSend(
        uint32 _dstEid,
        bytes memory _message,
        bytes memory _options,
        MessagingFee memory _fee,
        address _refundAddress   <<<
    ) internal virtual returns (MessagingReceipt memory receipt) {
       //...
            endpoint.send{ value: messageValue }(
                MessagingParams(_dstEid, _getPeerOrRevert(_dstEid), _message, _options, _fee.lzTokenFee > 0),
                _refundAddress   <<<
            );
    }
```

Also we can see that `msg.value` not fully used - only `_nativeFee` will be sent to Endpoint. Remaining amount not sent back and stuck in `SolConnector.sol`.
```solidity
uint256 messageValue = _payNative(_fee.nativeFee);
endpoint.send{ value: messageValue }(...);

 function _payNative(uint256 _nativeFee) internal virtual returns (uint256 nativeFee) {
        // enable the OApp to pay the native fee
        if (msg.value < _nativeFee && address(this).balance < _nativeFee) revert NotEnoughNative(msg.value);
        return _nativeFee;
    }
```

>IMPORTANT NOTE

Sending `msg.value` greater than `nativeFee` is not a user mistake:
>Because cross-chain gas fees are dynamic, this quote should be generated right before calling _lzSend to ensure accurate pricing. [Sour—Åe](https://docs.layerzero.network/v2/developers/evm/oapp/overview#implementing-_lzsend:~:text=Because%20cross%2Dchain%20gas%20fees%20are%20dynamic%2C%20this%20quote%20should%20be%20generated%20right%20before%20calling%20_lzSend%20to%20ensure%20accurate%20pricing.)

Users always need to overpay the fee to send message, thats why any protocols that implementing LayerZero must also implement the refunding mechanism correctly.

### Internal pre-conditions

`endpoint.quote()` returns `_fee.nativeFee` that is less than `msg.value`.

### External pre-conditions

Endpoint sends excess fees back to `_refundAddress`.

### Attack Path

1. Amelie makes a withdrawal request and sends `msg.value` = 0.2 ETH to pay for cross-chain gas fees.
2. Only 0.15 ETH is used, Amelie expects the remaining 0.05 ETH to be sent to the `refundAddress`, back to her.
3. 0.05 ETH is stuck in `SolConnector.sol`.


### Impact

User lost all unused amount from `msg.value` and excess fees.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Allow user to specify the `_refundAddress` and send whole `msg.value` to Endpoint, `SolConnector.sol` should not hold any excess fees.
