# Excess fees refunded by endpoint will be stuck in `SolConnector` as it has no function to transfer them out

### Summary

Excess fees refunded by endpoint will be stuck in `SolConnector` as it has no function to transfer them out

`OappSenderUpgradeable::_quote` gives an **estimate of the fees** to sucessfully transmit a message from the src chain to the dst chain. If there is an excess of `fees` once finally executed, the excess is refunded [to the `_refundAddress`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-09-orderly-network-solana-contract/tree/main/sol-cc/blob/main/contracts/layerzerolabs/lz-evm-oapp-v2/contracts/oapp/OAppSenderUpgradeable.sol#L87-L87) which is configured as [`address(this)`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-09-orderly-network-solana-contract/tree/main/sol-cc/blob/main/contracts/SolConnector.sol#L97).

### Root Cause

- `_lzSend` with `_refundAddress` is `address(this)`: [link](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-09-orderly-network-solana-contract/tree/main/sol-cc/blob/main/contracts/SolConnector.sol#L97)
- `_lzSend` implementation showing fees will be refunded: [link](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-09-orderly-network-solana-contract/tree/main/sol-cc/blob/main/contracts/layerzerolabs/lz-evm-oapp-v2/contracts/oapp/OAppSenderUpgradeable.sol#L87-L87)
- `_quote` is an [estimate](https://docs.layerzero.network/v2/developers/evm/oapp/overview#estimating-gas-fees)


### Internal pre-conditions

- `SolConnector` send the quoted `_msgFee`


### External pre-conditions

- Fees ar lower than expected and excess is refunded


### Attack Path

- Caller of `SolConnector::withdraw` uses the LayerZero `quote` function to estimate the `_msgFee`
- The fees are over-estimated and the excess is refunded to `address(this)`
- As there is no function to recover the fees, fees are stuck

### Impact

- Fees stuck in contract


### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Add a mechanism to be able to withdraw the fees
