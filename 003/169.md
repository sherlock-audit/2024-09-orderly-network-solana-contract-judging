# SolCOnnector.sol address passed to lzSend() will cause fees refunded to be stucked

### Summary

SolCOnnector.sol address passed to lzSend() will cause fees refunded to be stucked

### Root Cause

lzsend() passes `address.this` as refund address in case the send call reverts, however, in this case the address.this would be the SolCOnnector contract but no way to withdraw in this contract causing fees refunded to be stucked.




### Internal pre-conditions

None

### External pre-conditions

Fees refunded

### Attack Path

n/a

### Impact

will cause fees refunded to be stucked

```solidity
bytes memory payload = MsgCodec.encodeWithdrawPayload(withdrawData);
        bytes memory lzWithdrawMsg = MsgCodec.encodeLzMsg(uint8(MsgCodec.MsgType.Withdraw), payload);
        bytes memory withdrawOptions = OptionsBuilder.newOptions().addExecutorLzReceiveOption(
            msgOptions[uint8(MsgCodec.MsgType.Withdraw)].gas,
            msgOptions[uint8(MsgCodec.MsgType.Withdraw)].value
        );
        MessagingFee memory _msgFee = _quote(solEid, lzWithdrawMsg, withdrawOptions, false);
        _lzSend(solEid, lzWithdrawMsg, withdrawOptions, _msgFee, address(this)); <@
 ```

### Mitigation

Recommendation:
Consider passing in an admin address that handles this instead of address.this or implement a way for withdrawal in the contract
