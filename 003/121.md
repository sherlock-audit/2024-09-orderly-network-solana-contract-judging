# Excess fees refunded by endpoint will be stuck in `solana-vault` as it has no instructions to transfer them out

### Summary

Refunded fees will be stuck in `solana-vault` program when the excess paid fees will be refunded.

`solana-vault::oapp_quote` allow to get [an **estimate of the required fees**](https://docs.layerzero.network/v2/developers/solana/oft/native#estimating-fees-and-calling-send) to sucessfully transmit a message from the src chain to the dst chain. If there is an excess of `fees` once finally executed, [the excess is refunded](https://docs.layerzero.network/v2/developers/evm/oapp/overview#example-sending-a-string).

### Root Cause

- [`solana-vault::oapp_quote`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-09-orderly-network-solana-contract/blob/main/solana-vault/packages/solana/contracts/programs/solana-vault/src/instructions/oapp_instr/oapp_quote.rs#L37-L37) gives an estimate of the required fees
- there is no way to withdraw the excess fees in solana-vault

### Internal pre-conditions

- the quoted fees are sent


### External pre-conditions

- Fees ar lower than expected and excess is refunded


### Attack Path

- Caller of `solana-vault::deposit` uses the LayerZero `quote` function to estimate the fees
- The fees are over-estimated and the excess is refunded
- As there is no function to recover the fees, fees are stuck


### Impact

- Fees stuck in contract


### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Add a mechanism to be able to withdraw the fees
