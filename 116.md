# Missing `msg.value` verification in `lzReceive` enables undervaluation exploit

### Summary

The `OAppReceivedUpgradable::lzReceive` function does not verify that the `msg.value` sent with a transaction matches the expected amount encoded within the `_message` payload. This discrepancy will allow attackers to bypass proper payment amounts by submitting insufficient funds with a valid payload, resulting in a potential underpayment for cross-chain message processing.

```javascript
     [sol-cc/contracts/layerzerolabs/lz-evm-oapp-v2/contracts/oapp/OAppReceiverUpgradeable.sol]
     101     function lzReceive(
     102         Origin calldata _origin,
     103         bytes32 _guid,
     104         bytes calldata _message,
     105         address _executor,
     106         bytes calldata _extraData
     107     ) public payable virtual {
     108         // Ensures that only the endpoint can attempt to lzReceive() messages to this OApp.
     109         if (address(endpoint) != msg.sender) revert OnlyEndpoint(msg.sender);
     110 
     111         // Ensure that the sender matches the expected peer for the source endpoint.
     112         if (_getPeerOrRevert(_origin.srcEid) != _origin.sender) revert OnlyPeer(_origin.srcEid, _origin.sender);
     113 
     114         // Call the internal OApp implementation of lzReceive.
     115         _lzReceive(_origin, _guid, _message, _executor, _extraData);
     116     }
```

### Root Cause

In `OAppReceivedUpgradable.sol`, the `msg.value` check is missing in the `lzReceive` function. Without verifying `msg.value` against the expected fee in `_message`, malicious actors can underpay, yet have their messages processed as if they met the full payment.

### Internal pre-conditions

- `msg.sender` calls `lzReceive` with a valid `_message` payload.
- `msg.value` is less than the fee expected in `_message`.
- `lzReceive` proceeds without validation and processes the message despite the insufficient payment.

### External pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

- Attacker constructs a legitimate `_message` payload that specifies a required fee (e.g., 1 Ether).
- Attacker calls `lzReceive()` with this payload but sets `msg.value` to an underpaid amount (e.g., 0.1 Ether).
- Since `msg.value` is not verified, `lzReceive` processes the message and does not revert, allowing the attacker to bypass proper payment.

### Impact

This vulnerability allows attackers to submit valid messages while circumventing full payment of the intended fees, leading to a potential economic impact on the protocol. Honest users may end up subsidizing underpaid transactions, and malicious actors can perform transactions at a fraction of the intended cost.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

To fix this issue, verify that `msg.value` meets the required amount encoded in `_message`. Example fix:

```javascript
// Assuming the expected amount is decoded from `_message`
uint256 expectedAmount = decodeExpectedAmount(_message);
require(msg.value >= expectedAmount, "Insufficient msg.value for transaction");
```
