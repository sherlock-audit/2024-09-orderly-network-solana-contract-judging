# The UUPS proxie standard is implemented incorrectly, making the protocol not upgradeable

### Summary

SolConnector.sol contracts inherit  OappUpgrrdeble and it inherits UUPSUpgradeable contract from Openzepelin, indicating that the devs of the protocol want to have the possibility of upgrading the above mentioned contracts at some point in the future.

the contracts also implement the OwnableUpgradeable contract, and the _authorizeUpgrade() function in both contracts has the onlyOwner modifer. This function is used to check whether the person who tries to update the implementation contract in the Proxy has the required access.
