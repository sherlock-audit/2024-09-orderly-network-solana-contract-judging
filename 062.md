# Missing Error Handling

### Summary

While you handle the encoding and sending of the message, there isnâ€™t any error handling for _lzSend or _quote. Although these functions likely revert on failure, it might be useful to include some form of logging or checks in the event that sending or fee calculation fails. I think it would be better to emit an event in case of failure:
```solidity
try _lzSend(...) {
    // success
} catch {
    emit SendFailed();
}
```
