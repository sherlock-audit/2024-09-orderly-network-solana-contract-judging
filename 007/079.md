# The SolConnector::withdraw() function is missing the whenNotPaused modifier.

### Summary

The SolConnector::withdraw() function lacks the whenNotPaused modifier, which means that even if the admin calls pause(), the withdrawal operation cannot be paused.

### Root Cause

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-09-orderly-network-solana-contract/blob/main/sol-cc/contracts/SolConnector.sol#L77
```javascript
@>> function withdraw(WithdrawDataSol calldata _withdrawData) external onlyLedger {
        AccountWithdrawSol memory withdrawData = AccountWithdrawSol(
            Utils.getSolAccountId(_withdrawData.sender, _withdrawData.brokerId),
            _withdrawData.sender,
            _withdrawData.receiver,
            Utils.calculateStringHash(_withdrawData.brokerId),
            Utils.calculateStringHash(_withdrawData.tokenSymbol),
            _withdrawData.tokenAmount,
            _withdrawData.fee,
            _withdrawData.chainId,
            _withdrawData.withdrawNonce
        );

        bytes memory payload = MsgCodec.encodeWithdrawPayload(withdrawData);
        bytes memory lzWithdrawMsg = MsgCodec.encodeLzMsg(uint8(MsgCodec.MsgType.Withdraw), payload);
        bytes memory withdrawOptions = OptionsBuilder.newOptions().addExecutorLzReceiveOption(
            msgOptions[uint8(MsgCodec.MsgType.Withdraw)].gas,
            msgOptions[uint8(MsgCodec.MsgType.Withdraw)].value
        );
        MessagingFee memory _msgFee = _quote(solEid, lzWithdrawMsg, withdrawOptions, false);
        _lzSend(solEid, lzWithdrawMsg, withdrawOptions, _msgFee, address(this));
    }
```
It can be observed that the SolConnector::withdraw() function lacks the whenNotPaused modifier. However, SolConnector inherits from OAppUpgradeable, which in turn inherits from PausableUpgradeable. The PausableUpgradeable contract includes the implementation of the pause() function.
```javascript
function pause() public onlyOwner {
        _pause();
    }
```
Therefore, it is clear that the development team intended to implement the pause functionality, but they mistakenly omitted the whenNotPaused modifier, resulting in the pause feature not functioning as intended.

### Internal pre-conditions

_No response_

### External pre-conditions

(1) In case of an emergency, the administrator needs to pause the withdraw function.
(2) The administrator calls pause(), but it fails to achieve the intended pause.

### Attack Path

_No response_

### Impact

This could result in the protocol being unable to pause the withdrawal function, leading to potential loss of funds.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

function withdraw() adds modify whenNotPaused.
