# SolConnector is not using whenPaused and whenNotPaused modifiers for withdrawals

### Summary

The `SolConnector` contract inherits OZ `PausableUpgradeable` contract and implements `pause`, and `unpause` functions. However, the contract does not use the `whenNotPaused` modifier for non-owner operations: deposits (`lz_receive`) and withdrawals (`withdraw`)

`SolConnector` inherits `OAppUpgradeable`:

`OAppUpgradeable` implements `pause`, `unpause` functions:

### Root Cause

`SolConnector` contract not using the `whenNotPaused` modifier for the non-owner functions.

### Internal pre-conditions

_No response_

### External pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

1. The admin calls the `pause` to pause processing of non-owner operations
2. The `withdraw` function and deposit (`lzreceive`) continue operations even after admin calls `pause`.

### Impact

Broken functionality: Continues user operations after pausing the contract.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Use `whenNotPaused` modifier appropriately.
