# rate_limiter is not used

### Summary

In [protocol's](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-09-orderly-network-solana-contract/blob/main/solana-vault/packages/solana/contracts/programs/solana-vault/src/instructions/oapp_instr/oapp_lz_receive.rs#L75) version of lzReceive, the rate at which the tokens are transferred is not limited.

In LayerZero's examples, rate limit is consumed and refilled for every transaction.

If there is a huge influx of transfer from EVM -> Solana and `vault_deposit_wallet` does not have enough funds, all messages will fail. 

### Root Cause

In LayerZero's [example](https://github.com/LayerZero-Labs/devtools/blob/9b70e96248fcb4d8772678ea7c4b74da6cc2bc0e/examples/oft-solana/programs/oft/src/instructions/lz_receive.rs#L101) of `lz_receive.rs`, `rate_limiter` is consumed and refilled:

```rust
        // Consume the inbound rate limiter
        if let Some(rate_limiter) = ctx.accounts.peer.inbound_rate_limiter.as_mut() {
            rate_limiter.try_consume(amount_received_ld)?;
        }
        // Refill the outbound rate limiter
        if let Some(rate_limiter) = ctx.accounts.peer.outbound_rate_limiter.as_mut() {
            rate_limiter.refill(amount_received_ld)?;
        }
```

This mechanism is not used in [Orderly](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-09-orderly-network-solana-contract/blob/main/solana-vault/packages/solana/contracts/programs/solana-vault/src/instructions/oapp_instr/oapp_lz_receive.rs#L75) protocol.

### Internal pre-conditions

_No response_

### External pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

_No response_

### Impact

If there is a high influx of EVM -> Solana transactions, the destination side might not be able to attend to all the transaction, leaving many transactions in failure.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Consider implementing rate limits on the destination chain, like how it is done in LayerZero.
