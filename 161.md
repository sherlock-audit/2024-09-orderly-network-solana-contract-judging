# Can't re-initialize `vault_authority` once initialized

### Summary

The `ReinitVault` struct uses the `init` constraint on the `vault_authority` account, which is intended only for initializing new accounts. This constraint prevents the function from reinitializing an existing `VaultAuthority` account. As a result, administrators are unable to update critical configuration parameters such as owner PubKey and nonces.

### Root Cause

In `reinit_vault.rs`, within the `ReinitVault` struct, the `vault_authority` account is incorrectly constrained with `init`, which only allows for new account creation:

This use of `init` causes the function to fail if the `vault_authority` account already exists, thereby preventing reinitialization of the existing configuration.

### Internal pre-conditions

1. The `vault_authority` account has already been initialized.
2. Administrators need to update the `VaultAuthority` configuration by reinitializing `vault_authority`.

### External pre-conditions

None

### Attack Path

This issue is due to a design flaw and is not exploitable by external actors.

### Impact

The inability to reinitialize the VaultAuthority configuration prevents the protocol from updating essential parameters like the owner public key and deposit/inbound nonce, leading to operational limitations and security risks.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Modify the ReinitVault struct to allow reinitialization of the existing vault_authority account by changing the `init` constraint to `mut`

```rust
    #[account(
        mut,  //init -> mut
        payer = admin,
        space = 8 + VaultAuthority::INIT_SPACE,
        seeds = [VAULT_AUTHORITY_SEED],
        bump
    )]
    pub vault_authority: Account<'info, VaultAuthority>,
```
