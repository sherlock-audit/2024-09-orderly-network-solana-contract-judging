# An attacker can repeatedly DoS `SolConnector` by sending maliciously deposit requests

### Summary

If `SolConnector::_lzReceive` reverts for any reason (e.g when calling `ledger.accountDepositSol`), the Solana Endpoint outbound nonce will be desync'd with the `SolConnector` internal nonce checker.
This state can be repeatedly activated by the attacker by sending incorrect `AccountDepositSol` (`vault_deposit_params` on the Solana side) to the ledger.

### Root Cause

- Everytime a message is sent from `solana-vault::deposit` instruction through `oapp::endpoint_cpi::send`, the `nonce.outbound_nonce` [gets incremented](https://github.com/LayerZero-Labs/LayerZero-v2/blob/7bcfb4d5dac4192570af5e51dbc67413a6116a14/packages/layerzero-v2/solana/programs/programs/endpoint/src/instructions/oapp/send.rs#L58) on the endpoint.
- Then, the message is sent [with this `outbound_nonce` attached](https://github.com/LayerZero-Labs/LayerZero-v2/blob/7bcfb4d5dac4192570af5e51dbc67413a6116a14/packages/layerzero-v2/solana/programs/programs/endpoint/src/instructions/oapp/send.rs#L70) to the packet to the destination chain.
- The issue is that `SolConnector` has implemented an [ordered delivery](https://docs.layerzero.network/v2/developers/evm/oapp/message-design-patterns#ordered-delivery) mechanism by requiring each new received message [to be in sync with its `inboundNonce`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-09-orderly-network-solana-contract/tree/main/sol-cc/blob/main/contracts/SolConnector.sol#L61)
- The user can call the `solana-vault::deposit` a specific [set of parameters](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-09-orderly-network-solana-contract/blob/main/solana-vault/packages/solana/contracts/programs/solana-vault/src/instructions/vault_instr/deposit.rs#L121-L129) that would make the call revert (e.g a wrong `account_id`) when executed by [`ledger.accountDepositSol`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-09-orderly-network-solana-contract/tree/main/sol-cc/blob/main/contracts/SolConnector.sol#L69-L69)
- The user can call the `solana-vault::deposit` instruction with a [`token_amount == 0`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-09-orderly-network-solana-contract/blob/main/solana-vault/packages/solana/contracts/programs/solana-vault/src/instructions/vault_instr/deposit.rs#L127) allowing him to grief the protocol for low costs.

### Internal pre-conditions

- `SolConnector::_lzReceive` reverts when receiving the message, which do not increase the nonce on the destination chain


### External pre-conditions

- a message is sucessfully sent from Solana which increase the nonce on the source chain


### Attack Path

- A malicious user continuously craft reverting message to de-sync the nonces which DoS `SolConnector`, causing honest request to revert when processed. Every time inboundNonce is set back to a correct value the attacker can send a new malicious request.

### Impact

Repeated/continous DoS of `SolConnector`


### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Consider changing for an unordered delivery mechanism on `SolConnector`, or requesting a minimum deposit of `token_amount` in `solana-vault::deposit`
