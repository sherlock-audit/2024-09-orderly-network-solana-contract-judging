# Inconsistent Data Encoding in `VaultDepositParams::decode`

### Summary

The decode function uses the same byte range (input[offset + 16..offset + 32]) to extract both src_chain_id and token_amount. This is incorrect, as these fields should be read from different offsets.

### Root Cause

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-09-orderly-network-solana-contract/blob/main/solana-vault/packages/solana/contracts/programs/solana-vault/src/instructions/msg_codec.rs#L34C1-L35C101

1. Incorrect Byte Offsets: The code uses the following lines to decode src_chain_id and token_amount:
```rust 
let src_chain_id = u128::from_be_bytes(input[offset + 16..offset + 32].try_into().unwrap());
let token_amount = u128::from_be_bytes(input[offset + 16..offset + 32].try_into().unwrap());
```
2. The problem is that both fields are being decoded from the same byte range (input[offset + 16..offset + 32]). This means they will always end up with the same value, which is incorrect.

3. Data Corruption: src_chain_id and token_amount are supposed to hold distinct pieces of information: the ID of the source chain and the amount of tokens deposited. Decoding them from the same bytes corrupts the data, leading to inconsistencies in the vault's state.

4. Consequences: This data corruption can have several severe consequences:

- Incorrect Routing of Funds: If the vault uses src_chain_id to determine where to send funds during withdrawals, the funds might be sent to the wrong chain due to the incorrect value.

- Incorrect Balance Calculations: The vault's internal accounting could be compromised because the token_amount is wrong. This could lead to incorrect balances, potentially allowing users to withdraw more tokens than they deposited.

#### Example:

Let's say the encoded data for src_chain_id is 0x0000000000000001 (chain ID 1) and for token_amount is 0x0000000000000064 (100 tokens). Due to the bug, both fields will be decoded as 0x0000000000000064. This means the vault will incorrectly record the deposit as coming from chain ID 100 with an amount of 100 tokens, even though it actually came from chain ID 1.

### Mitigation

```rust 
impl VaultDepositParams {
    pub fn decode(input: &[u8]) -> Result<Self> {
        // ... (other field decoding) ...

        let src_chain_id = u128::from_be_bytes(input[offset..offset + 16].try_into().unwrap());
        offset += 16; // Increment offset after decoding src_chain_id
        let token_amount = u128::from_be_bytes(input[offset..offset + 16].try_into().unwrap());
        offset += 16; // Increment offset after decoding token_amount

        // ... (rest of the decoding) ...
    }
}
```
