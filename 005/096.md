# The absence of the addExecutorOrderedExecutionOption parameter causes the ordered delivery mode to fail.

### Summary

The absence of the addExecutorOrderedExecutionOption parameter causes the ordered delivery mode to fail, This may cause user funds to become stuck in the protocol.

### Root Cause

**According to the LayerZero documentation:**
https://docs.layerzero.network/v2/developers/evm/oapp/message-design-patterns#message-ordering

To implement strict nonce enforcement, you need to implement the following:

a mapping to track the maximum received nonce.

override _acceptNonce and nextNonce.

add ExecutorOrderedExecutionOption in _options when calling _lzSend.

However, in the EVM side oApp of the orderly chain:

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-09-orderly-network-solana-contract/blob/main/sol-cc/contracts/SolConnector.sol#L92

```javascript
@>> bytes memory withdrawOptions = OptionsBuilder.newOptions().addExecutorLzReceiveOption(
            msgOptions[uint8(MsgCodec.MsgType.Withdraw)].gas,
            msgOptions[uint8(MsgCodec.MsgType.Withdraw)].value
        );
        MessagingFee memory _msgFee = _quote(solEid, lzWithdrawMsg, withdrawOptions, false);
        _lzSend(solEid, lzWithdrawMsg, withdrawOptions, _msgFee, address(this));
```
The ExecutorOrderedExecutionOption option was not added. 
Similarly, in the Solana oApp:
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-09-orderly-network-solana-contract/blob/main/solana-vault/packages/solana/contracts/programs/solana-vault/src/instructions/vault_instr/deposit.rs#L141
```rust
@>>       let options = EnforcedOptions::get_enforced_options(&ctx.accounts.enforced_options, &None);

        let endpoint_send_params = EndpointSendParams {
            dst_eid: ctx.accounts.vault_authority.dst_eid,
            receiver: ctx.accounts.peer.address,
            message: lz_message,
@>>            options: options,
            native_fee: oapp_params.native_fee,
            lz_token_fee: oapp_params.lz_token_fee,
        };

        let receipt = oapp::endpoint_cpi::send(
            ctx.accounts.oapp_config.endpoint_program,
            ctx.accounts.oapp_config.key(),
            ctx.remaining_accounts,
            seeds,
            endpoint_send_params,
        )?;
```
The ExecutorOrderedExecutionOption option was also not added. As a result, the ordered delivery mode will fail, especially since the ordered delivery mode is enabled by default in the EVM-side oApp on the orderly chain.

### Internal pre-conditions

_No response_

### External pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

_No response_

### Impact

1.	The ordered delivery mode on both the Solana and EVM-side oApp cannot function properly.
	
2.	This further impacts users by causing their funds to be stuck in the protocol. Here’s an example with deposit():
	•	(1) Users A and B deposit 1000 USDC almost simultaneously.
	•	(2) LayerZero’s execute function assigns the same nonce to both transactions via nextNonce(), assumed to be 1 for both.
	•	(3) On the EVM side, only one of the messages from User A or User B will execute successfully. After one execution succeeds, inboundNonce increments to 1, but _origin.nonce remains 1. This results in the require(_origin.nonce == inboundNonce + 1) check failing, causing one user’s funds to remain stuck on the Solana side, unable to reach the orderly EVM side.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Append to your Message Options an ExecutorOrderedExecutionOption in your _lzSend call,like:
```javascript
// appends "01000104", the ExecutorOrderedExecutionOption, to your options bytes array
_options = OptionsBuilder.newOptions().addExecutorLzReceiveOption(200000, 0).addExecutorOrderedExecutionOption();
```
