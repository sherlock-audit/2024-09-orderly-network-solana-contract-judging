# Missing LayerZero Ordered Execution Option For Orderly Chain Messages

### Summary

Missing ordered execution enforcement will cause message rejection vulnerability for users as unordered messages will update balances on Orderly Chain's ledger but fail on Solana vault due to message ordering mismatch.

### Root Cause

In https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-09-orderly-network-solana-contract/blob/main/sol-cc/contracts/SolConnector.sol#L92 the withdraw implementation only applies basic gas/value options without ordered execution option:
solidityCopybytes memory withdrawOptions = OptionsBuilder.newOptions().addExecutorLzReceiveOption(
    msgOptions[uint8(MsgCodec.MsgType.Withdraw)].gas,
    msgOptions[uint8(MsgCodec.MsgType.Withdraw)].value
);
LayerZero will not guarantee ordered message delivery in absence of this option.

### Internal pre-conditions

1. Ordered delivery is enabled on Solana vault side and Orderly chain
2. Multiple withdrawals are processed in quick succession

### External pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

1. User A and User B submit withdrawals close together
2. SolConnector sends messages with only gas/value options configured
3. LayerZero messages arrive out of order at Solana vault due to missing ordered execution option
4. Solana vault rejects out-of-order messages with InvalidInboundNonce error
5. Ledger contract has already updated balances on Orderly Chain
6. Balance state becomes inconsistent between chains

### Impact

Users suffer from state inconsistency where their balances are reduced on Orderly Chain's ledger but funds remain locked in Solana vault due to message rejection. User may effectively lose funds and to resolve this  extensive manual intervention may be required by admin.
