# Executor can revert if in order execution is enabled

### Summary

The [withdraw](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-09-orderly-network-solana-contract/blob/main/sol-cc/contracts/SolConnector.sol#L77) call does not specify the `ExecutorOrderedExecutionOption` option, which will cause the Executor to execute out-of-order messages, leading to a message revert.

### Root Cause

Accoding to the [LayerZero V2 docs](https://docs.layerzero.network/v2/developers/evm/oapp/message-design-patterns#code-example-2):
> If you do not pass an `ExecutorOrderedExecutionOption` in your `_lzSend` call, the Executor will attempt to execute the message despite your application-level nonce enforcement, leading to a message revert.

### Internal pre-conditions

1. Admin needs to call [`setOrderDelivery`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-09-orderly-network-solana-contract/blob/main/sol-cc/contracts/SolConnector.sol#L121) to set `orderDelivery` to `true`

### External pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

1. User A sends a message with nonce `n`
2. User B sends a message with nonce `n + 1` and this message is verified on Layer Zero
3. User C sends a message with nonce `n + 2`
4. Executor tries to execute message with nonce `n + 1` but it reverts due to in-order execution expecting nonce `n`
5. Nonces `n` and `n + 2` are verified
6. Executor executes message with nonce `n`
7. Executor tries to execute message with nonce `n + 2` but it reverts due to in-order execution expecting nonce `n + 1`

### Impact

All the messages starting from the failing message need to be re-executed. This might result in a temporary fund unavailability.

### PoC

None

### Mitigation

Consider adding the `ExecutorOrderedExecutionOption` option in case of order delivery.

        );

        _lzSend(solEid, lzWithdrawMsg, withdrawOptions, _msgFee, address(this));
