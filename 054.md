# Missing fee payment will prevent users from withdrawing tokens

### Summary

The `withdraw` function not requiring users to pay the LayerZero bridging fees will cause users to be unable to withdraw tokens as messages are impossible to relay to the Solana chain. If the protocol opts to fund the contract with ETH to pay the fees on behalf of users, this can be exploited by attackers performing multiple withdrawals of small amounts, draining the contract's ETH balance. Therefore, the logical approach is for the users to pay the bridging fees which is not in place currently.

### Root Cause

In [`SolConnector.sol:96`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-09-orderly-network-solana-contract/blob/main/sol-cc/contracts/SolConnector.sol#L96), the `withdraw` function is not payable and does not require users to pay the LayerZero fee, resulting in messages that cannot be relayed due to lack of funds.

### Internal pre-conditions

None

### External pre-conditions

None

### Attack Path

1. **User calls** the `withdraw` function to withdraw tokens.
2. **The contract attempts** to relay the message to the Solana chain without sufficient funds to cover the LayerZero fees.
3. **The call reverts and** the message fails to be relayed due to lack of fee payment, preventing the user from withdrawing tokens.

### Impact

_No response_

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Make the `withdraw` function payable and require users to supply the necessary ETH to cover the LayerZero bridging fees, ensuring messages can be successfully relayed.
