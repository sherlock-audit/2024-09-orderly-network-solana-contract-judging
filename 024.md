# Any broker marked as allowed can make a Transaction on the vault

### Summary

The allowed_broker account is derived using a seed that includes deposit_params.broker_hash. While there is a constraint to check if the broker is allowed (allowed == true), there is no explicit validation to ensure that the broker_hash provided in the deposit_params matches the hash used to derive the allowed_broker account. This means that while a broker might be marked as allowed, the system does not verify if the broker hash provided by the user corresponds exactly to the allowed broker's hash.


### Root Cause

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-09-orderly-network-solana-contract/blob/main/solana-vault/packages/solana/contracts/programs/solana-vault/src/instructions/vault_instr/deposit.rs#L77-L81

### Internal pre-conditions

Any pda account of `allowed_broker` type should have a allowed boolean set as true.


### Impact

User Can provide any `allowed_broker` account where the value of the broker allowed is set to true, allowing to it to make a transaction even if the the broken was not even allowed to make transactions on the vault. 

Secondly, this vulnerability allows for the injection of unauthorized brokers into legitimate transactions, undermining the integrity of the system and exposing users to fraudulent activities. Lastly, the exploitation of this flaw could result in substantial reputational damage for the platform, eroding user trust and potentially leading to a decrease in user engagement and platform utilization.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

To mitigate this risk, it is crucial to implement a direct validation step that checks if the broker_hash provided by the user matches the hash used to derive the allowed_broker account. This could be achieved by:
```diff
    #[account(
        seeds = [BROKER_SEED, deposit_params.broker_hash.as_ref()],
        bump = allowed_broker.bump,
        constraint =
+   allowed_broker.broker_hash == deposit_params.broker_hash &&
     allowed_broker.allowed == true @ VaultError::BrokerNotAllowed
    )]
    pub allowed_broker: Box<Account<'info, AllowedBroker>>,
    ```
