# [High] Missing `deposit_token` Validation in Orderly Vaults deposit Instruction Allows Unauthorized Cross-Chain Transfers

### Summary

The missing validation of `deposit_token` in the deposit instruction within the Orderly Vaults implementation allows attackers to deposit arbitrary tokens, potentially leading to unauthorized fund transfers across chains. Based on the LayerZero OFT model, which verifies `token_mint` during send instructions, Orderly Vaults should similarly validate token_mint in the deposit instruction to prevent unauthorized tokens from being deposited and transferred.

### Root Cause

The design of the deposit instruction in Orderly Vaults does not validate `deposit_token`, allowing it to act as a free account rather than verifying it as the intended token. Without validation, arbitrary tokens can be deposited and processed for cross-chain transfers, compromising the security of the Orderly Vaults system.

### Internal pre-conditions

- The deposit instruction in Orderly Vaults is called without `deposit_token` validation.
- The user submits arbitrary token data in DepositParams, which is not checked against expected tokens.

### External pre-conditions

- The user has access to the deposit function in Orderly Vaults and can submit tokens for cross-chain transfers.
- No external validation mechanism exists to ensure `deposit_token` is the expected token for deposits.

### Attack Path

- The attacker initiates a deposit call in Orderly Vaults, providing `DepositParams` with an arbitrary token account.
- Without `deposit_token` validation, the deposit is accepted, allowing the attacker to bypass expected token requirements.
- The attacker sends the unvalidated tokens across chains via Orderly Vaults, potentially resulting in unauthorized fund transfers.

### Impact

Orderly Vaults could suffer losses as unauthorized tokens are deposited and transferred across chains. This vulnerability allows users to send arbitrary tokens that are not verified against `deposit_token`, which can lead to misuse of the cross-chain transfer mechanism and potential fund siphoning.
