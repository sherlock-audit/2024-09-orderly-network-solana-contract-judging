# Unauthorized user will reinitialize `VaultAuthority`

### Summary

Missing check in the `init_vault` call will cause a privilege escalation of `VaultAuthority` as the attacker will reinitialize the `VaultAuthority`.

### Root Cause

The `InitVault` accounts struct does not restrict the caller ([see here](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-09-orderly-network-solana-contract/blob/main/solana-vault/packages/solana/contracts/programs/solana-vault/src/instructions/vault_instr/init_vault.rs#L12-L19)).
The `init_vault` instruction does not check for reinitialization ([see here](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-09-orderly-network-solana-contract/blob/main/solana-vault/packages/solana/contracts/programs/solana-vault/src/instructions/vault_instr/init_vault.rs#L25-L34)).
Vault reinitialization should only be possible by the `OAppConfig` admin ([see here](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-09-orderly-network-solana-contract/blob/main/solana-vault/packages/solana/contracts/programs/solana-vault/src/instructions/vault_instr/reinit_vault.rs#L7-L25)).

### Internal pre-conditions

1. `VaultAuthority` owner calls [`reset_vault`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-09-orderly-network-solana-contract/blob/main/solana-vault/packages/solana/contracts/programs/solana-vault/src/instructions/vault_instr/reset_vault.rs#L22) to reset vault authority account

### External pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

1. Attacker calls [`init_vault`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-09-orderly-network-solana-contract/blob/main/solana-vault/packages/solana/contracts/programs/solana-vault/src/instructions/vault_instr/init_vault.rs#L25) and takes over the Vault Authority account

### Impact

Unauthorized users will gain authority over the `VaultAuthority` account.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Consider adding a check to the `init_vault` instruction to ensure that it can only be called once or by authorized users. Alternatively, consider pairing this instruction with the OApp Config init instruction.
