# PDA Initialization Front-running Vulnerability

### Summary


https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-09-orderly-network-solana-contract/blob/main/solana-vault/packages/solana/contracts/programs/solana-vault/src/instructions/vault_instr/init_vault.rs#L7-L22
in the init_vault.rs contains a potential front-running vulnerability during the Program Derived Address (PDA) initialization. This vulnerability arises from the use of a static seed (VAULT_AUTHORITY_SEED) when deriving the PDA, which allows an attacker to predict the address and potentially front-run the initialization, taking control of the vault authority.

### Root Cause

The PDA for the vault_authority account is derived from a static seed (VAULT_AUTHORITY_SEED) without any dynamic or user-specific data. Since PDAs in Solana are computed deterministically from seeds, the resulting address can be predicted by anyone who knows the seed, leading to a potential front-running attack.
Vulnerable Code Section:
```rust
#[account(
    init,
    payer = signer,
    space = 8 + VaultAuthority::INIT_SPACE,
    seeds = [VAULT_AUTHORITY_SEED],
    bump
)]
pub vault_authority: Account<'info, VaultAuthority>,
```

### Internal pre-conditions

1. The program uses a static seed (VAULT_AUTHORITY_SEED) to derive the PDA for the vault_authority account.
2. The initialization of the vault_authority account is triggered by the user's transaction.
3. The vault is intended to be initialized only once by the user, with specific ownership and parameters defined during initialization.


### External pre-conditions

1. An attacker has access to the source code or is aware of the seed (VAULT_AUTHORITY_SEED) used to derive the PDA.
2. The attacker is capable of front-running the legitimate transaction by submitting a competing transaction with higher priority (e.g., by using more resources for transaction fees).
3. The attacker is able to compute the PDA using the static seed and is aware that the initialization process has not yet been completed by the intended user.

### Attack Path

1. The attacker monitors the network for an uninitialized vault authority account or pre-computes the PDA from the known static seed (VAULT_AUTHORITY_SEED).
2. Upon identifying that the vault_authority PDA is available for initialization, the attacker submits a competing transaction that initializes the vault_authority account with their own parameters.
3.  The legitimate user's transaction fails because the account is already initialized, leaving the attacker in control of the vault authority.
4. The attacker gains access to the vault, allowing them to manipulate the vault's parameters, intercept deposits, or block future access to the vault by the intended owner.


### Impact

If successfully exploited, the front-running attack allows the attacker to take full control of the vault_authority PDA, which can lead to:
1. Loss of Funds: The attacker can intercept deposits into the vault or withdraw any funds stored in the vault.
2. Denial of Service: The legitimate user is permanently locked out from initializing their vault authority, preventing them from using the vault.
3. Trust Exploitation: Users interacting with the vault may suffer financial loss or be unable to retrieve their funds.
This type of vulnerability could cause significant damage to the reputation of the platform and result in a loss of user trust and participation.



### PoC

Step 1: Attacker retrieves the static seed (VAULT_AUTHORITY_SEED) from the source code or by reverse-engineering the deployed contract.

Step 2: The attacker computes the PDA for the vault_authority using the static seed and the program ID.

```javascript
const vaultAuthorityPDA = await PublicKey.findProgramAddress(
  [Buffer.from("VAULT_AUTHORITY_SEED")],
  programId
);
```

Step 3: The attacker submits a transaction to initialize the vault_authority PDA before the legitimate user does, providing their own malicious parameters for the vault.

Step 4: The legitimate user attempts to initialize the vault_authority, but the transaction fails because the PDA is already initialized.

### Mitigation

To prevent front-running attacks during PDA initialization, the following mitigations should be applied:
1. Use Dynamic Seeds: Include dynamic or user-specific data (e.g., the signer's public key) when deriving the PDA to ensure that each PDA is unique per user. This makes it impossible for an attacker to predict the PDA for another user's vault.

Improved PDA Derivation:
```rust
#[account(
    init,
    payer = signer,
    space = 8 + VaultAuthority::INIT_SPACE,
    seeds = [VAULT_AUTHORITY_SEED, signer.key().as_ref()],
    bump
)]
pub vault_authority: Account<'info, VaultAuthority>,
```

This approach binds the PDA to the user's public key (signer.key()), ensuring that only the intended user can initialize the vault_authority.

2. Timestamp or Randomness: Alternatively, include a timestamp, nonce, or other unpredictable data in the seed to further prevent pre-computation of the PDA.

3. Transaction Sequencing: Ensure that initialization functions are designed to check whether the PDA is already initialized before proceeding, to prevent re-initialization attempts.
