# Anyone can `init_oapp()` after it has been reset allowing them to drain SolanaVault's token balance

### Summary

The combination of allowing admins to reset both [`oapp_config`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-09-orderly-network-solana-contract/blob/main/solana-vault/packages/solana/contracts/programs/solana-vault/src/instructions/oapp_instr/reset_oapp.rs#L21-L27) and [`vault_authority`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-09-orderly-network-solana-contract/blob/main/solana-vault/packages/solana/contracts/programs/solana-vault/src/instructions/vault_instr/reset_vault.rs#L22-L28) while leaving [`init_vault()`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-09-orderly-network-solana-contract/blob/main/solana-vault/packages/solana/contracts/programs/solana-vault/src/instructions/vault_instr/init_vault.rs#L25-L35) and [`init_oapp`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-09-orderly-network-solana-contract/blob/main/solana-vault/packages/solana/contracts/programs/solana-vault/src/instructions/oapp_instr/init_oapp.rs#L31-L45) open to all can allow an attacker to take over the critical configuration of SolanaVault.

**NOTE:** This is different from the KNOWN ISSUE of front-running during PDA initialization. This is a reinitialization issue enabled by resetting account state.

### Root Cause

[`reset_oapp.rs::apply():8-27`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-09-orderly-network-solana-contract/blob/main/solana-vault/packages/solana/contracts/programs/solana-vault/src/instructions/oapp_instr/reset_oapp.rs#L8-L27) allows the OApp Admin to reset `oapp_config`. This enables anyone to **reinitialize** the `oapp_config` to any configuration they want by calling [`init_oapp()`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-09-orderly-network-solana-contract/blob/main/solana-vault/packages/solana/contracts/programs/solana-vault/src/instructions/oapp_instr/init_oapp.rs#L31-L45). 

The same issue exists in `vault_authority` with [`reset_vault()`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-09-orderly-network-solana-contract/blob/main/solana-vault/packages/solana/contracts/programs/solana-vault/src/instructions/vault_instr/reset_vault.rs#L7-L28) and [`init_vault()`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-09-orderly-network-solana-contract/blob/main/solana-vault/packages/solana/contracts/programs/solana-vault/src/instructions/vault_instr/init_vault.rs#L25-L35).

### Internal pre-conditions

1. Oapp Config admin calls [`reset_oapp()`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-09-orderly-network-solana-contract/blob/main/solana-vault/packages/solana/contracts/programs/solana-vault/src/instructions/oapp_instr/reset_oapp.rs#L21-L27).

### External pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

1. Attacker calls [`init_oapp()`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-09-orderly-network-solana-contract/blob/main/solana-vault/packages/solana/contracts/programs/solana-vault/src/instructions/oapp_instr/init_oapp.rs#L31-L45) and sets the [endpoint program](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-09-orderly-network-solana-contract/blob/main/solana-vault/packages/solana/contracts/programs/solana-vault/src/instructions/oapp_instr/init_oapp.rs#L40) to a program they control. This program they control implements the endpoint interface.
2. Since the Attacker controls the Endpoint program, they can have it accept any message they send and block all other messages. They can call [`lz_receive()`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-09-orderly-network-solana-contract/blob/main/solana-vault/packages/solana/contracts/programs/solana-vault/src/lib.rs#L69-L71) on SolanaVault with a payload that withdraws all of SolanaVault's USDC and their Endpoint program will allow it when the instruction calls [`endpoint::clear`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-09-orderly-network-solana-contract/blob/main/solana-vault/packages/solana/contracts/programs/solana-vault/src/instructions/oapp_instr/oapp_lz_receive.rs#L79-L92).

### Impact

All of the token balance SolanaVault holds is at risk. This issue leads to a permanent loss of funds.

### PoC

Copy [diff](https://gist.github.com/gjaldon/c8d078d2e90886a45a6c6741e8c835c3) into a file (file.diff) and then `git apply file.diff` from the repo's root.

Run anchor test and it will run the test `'attacker initializes vault after reset'`. The test shows how anyone can call `init_vault()` to take over the vault after it was `reset()` by the previous vault authority. 

### Mitigation

Consider removing the ability to reset `oapp_config` and `vault_authority` or limiting the access to `init_vault()` and `init_oapp` to a privileged role like the upgrade authority.
