# PDA Initialization can be front run

### Summary

The use of a static seed `(VAULT_AUTHORITY_SEED)` when deriving the Program Derived Address (PDA) for the vault_authority account. PDAs in Solana are deterministic, meaning the address can be predicted if the seed is known. Without incorporating dynamic or user-specific data into the seed, this leaves the initialization process of the vault vulnerable to front-running attacks.

### Root Cause

When initializing vault  https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-09-orderly-network-solana-contract/blob/main/solana-vault/packages/solana/contracts/programs/solana-vault/src/instructions/vault_instr/init_vault.rs#L11-L19 An attacker, knowing the static seed and monitoring the Solana network, can predict the PDA and submit a transaction with higher priority before the legitimate user

### Attack Path

_No response_

### Impact

Attacker can potentially hijack the entire vault's ownership and its associated funds or parameters. As a result, the intended user is locked out, and the vault is compromised.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Use Dynamic Seeds

```rs
#[account(
    init,
    payer = signer,
    space = 8 + VaultAuthority::INIT_SPACE,
    seeds = [VAULT_AUTHORITY_SEED, signer.key().as_ref()],
    bump
)]
pub vault_authority: Account<'info, VaultAuthority>,
```
