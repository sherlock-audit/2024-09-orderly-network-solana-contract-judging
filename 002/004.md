# Vault Authority initialization can be frontrun - rendering vault contract useless

### Summary

Missing authority checks in `solana_vault::instructions::vault_instr::init_vault` allows an attacker to frontrun initialization and brick the solana-vault program.

### Root Cause

The `InitVault` function is used to initialize the `vault_authority` account and contains no authority checks. Although the FAQ states “Some PDA initilization call has no admin check”, it hasn’t stated any acceptable risks, and bricking the vault doesn’t seem like it would be acceptable.

This function creates and initializes the `vault_authority` account, and uses the user provided params to set the account’s data fields. It uses a single seed of `VAULT_AUTHORITY_SEED`, which means there is only 1 possible PDA that can ever be created, and the function can only ever be called once (due to the `init` constraint).

Once the vault program is deployed, a malicious user can frontrun initialization of the `vault_authority` account and provide their own params. This will set fields such as the `owner`, `dst_eid`, and `sol_chain_id`. If the `vault_authority` is initialized with these unintended values, it effectively bricks the vault program (eg using an unsupported `dst_eid`.

```rust
#[derive(Accounts)]
#[instruction()]
pub struct InitVault<'info> {
    #[account(mut)]
    pub signer: Signer<'info>,

    #[account(
        init, // Account can only be initialized once.
        payer = signer,
        space = 8 + VaultAuthority::INIT_SPACE,
        seeds = [VAULT_AUTHORITY_SEED], // Static seed so only 1 valid vault_authority can exist.
        bump
    )]
    pub vault_authority: Account<'info, VaultAuthority>,

    pub system_program: Program<'info, System>,
}

impl InitVault<'_> {
    pub fn apply(ctx: Context<InitVault>, params: &InitVaultParams) -> Result<()> {
        // vault_authority fields are set with user provided params.        
        ctx.accounts.vault_authority.bump = ctx.bumps.vault_authority;
        ctx.accounts.vault_authority.owner = params.owner;
        ctx.accounts.vault_authority.deposit_nonce = 0;
        ctx.accounts.vault_authority.order_delivery = params.order_delivery;
        ctx.accounts.vault_authority.inbound_nonce = 0;
        ctx.accounts.vault_authority.dst_eid = params.dst_eid;
        ctx.accounts.vault_authority.sol_chain_id = params.sol_chain_id;
        msg!("Vault authority initialized");
        Ok(())
    }
}
```

A `ReinitVault` instruction exists, which can reset these fields to new params, however it requires that the signer is the `oapp_config.admin`. 

Unfortunately the `OAppConfig` initialization suffers from the same vulnerability, allowing a malicious user to also frontrun initializion of this and setting themselves as admin - please see issue #2 for the OAppConfig vulnerability.

This means an attacker would control both the vault_authority and oapp_config accounts, making resetting them impossible.

### Internal pre-conditions

- Orderly team needs to deploy solana-vault program.

### External pre-conditions

N/A

### Attack Path

1. Orderly team deploys the solana-vault program
2. Attacker immediately sends a `InitVault` instruction with the correctly derived `vault_authority` PDA key, and arbitrary parameters.

### Impact

Invalid parameters such as the `dst_eid` can be set, resulting in the vault not being able to send messages to Orderly.

The program would need to be redeployed, although an attacker could again frontrun initialization on newly deployed contracts until the bug is removed from the codebase.



### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

An additional seed of the signer’s key can be used, allowing `vault_authority` accounts to be created multiple times by different accounts.

This will ensure the Orderly team can create a `vault_authority`, even if frontrun by a malicious user. Care will need to be taken in other areas of the code that may make certain assumptions about `VaultAuthority` accounts, since multiple may now exist. 

```rust
#[derive(Accounts)]
#[instruction()]
pub struct InitVault<'info> {
    #[account(mut)]
    pub signer: Signer<'info>,

    #[account(
        init,
        payer = signer,
        space = 8 + VaultAuthority::INIT_SPACE,
        seeds = [VAULT_AUTHORITY_SEED, signer.key().as_ref()], // Add signer's key as a seed.
        bump
    )]
    pub vault_authority: Account<'info, VaultAuthority>,

    pub system_program: Program<'info, System>,
}
```

Alternatively, hardcode the expected account that should be initializing it and use a constraint.

```rust

const EXPECTED_CALLER: Pubkey = pubkey!("4wPQVGnhGwU4SVhMRFAJCr2YHNCfCZschyHCbbmtzTHm"); // Replace with deployer's account key.

#[derive(Accounts)]
#[instruction()]
pub struct InitVault<'info> {
    #[account(mut, constraint = signer.key() == EXPECTED_CALLER)]
    pub signer: Signer<'info>,

    #[account(
        init,
        payer = signer,
        space = 8 + VaultAuthority::INIT_SPACE,
        seeds = [VAULT_AUTHORITY_SEED],
        bump,
    )]
    pub vault_authority: Account<'info, VaultAuthority>,

    pub system_program: Program<'info, System>,
}
```
