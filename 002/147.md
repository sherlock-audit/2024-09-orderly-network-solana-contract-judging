# Incorrect Use of init Constraint in ReinitOApp Instruction

### Summary

The `ReinitOApp` instruction improperly uses the `init` constraint on the `oapp_config` account, which leads to an error when attempting to reinitialize an account that already exists. The correct behavior must involve modifying the existing account using the `mut` constraint, rather than attempting to reinitialize it.

### Root Cause

The [init constraint](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-09-orderly-network-solana-contract/blob/main/solana-vault/packages/solana/contracts/programs/solana-vault/src/instructions/oapp_instr/reinit_oapp.rs#L12) is used on the oapp_config account in the ReinitOApp instruction. This constraint is meant for account creation and causes an error when attempting to reinitialize an existing account. In reinitialization cases, the `mut` constraint should be used instead.

### Internal pre-conditions

The `ReinitOApp` instruction must be explicitly called to update the existing `oapp_config` account.

### External pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

1. The ReinitOApp instruction incorrectly uses the init constraint on the existing oapp_config account.
2. Since the account already exists, the program throws an error because the init constraint attempts to create the account again.


### Impact

This issue causes a failure in the ReinitOApp instruction, preventing updates to critical fields such as admin and usdc_hash in the oapp_config account. 

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Replace the init constraint in the ReinitOApp instruction with the mut constraint to allow the existing oapp_config account to be modified without attempting to recreate it. This will ensure that reinitialization occurs as intended without causing errors.
