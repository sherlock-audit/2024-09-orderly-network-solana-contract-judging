# `withdraw` function is not updating the contract state that leads to draining of all the funds

### Summary

The core issue lies in the order of operations within the `withdraw` function. It sends a cross-chain message (`_lzSend`) to the Solana chain before updating the contract's state to reflect the withdrawal. This creates a window for an attacker to re-enter the `withdraw` function and exploit the outdated state.



### Root Cause

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-09-orderly-network-solana-contract/blob/main/sol-cc/contracts/SolConnector.sol#L77C5-L98C6

```solidity
function withdraw(WithdrawDataSol calldata _withdrawData) external onlyLedger {
    // ... (Data preparation) ...

    // Construct the cross-chain message

    // Send the cross-chain message
    MessagingFee memory _msgFee = _quote(solEid, lzWithdrawMsg, withdrawOptions, false);
    _lzSend(solEid, lzWithdrawMsg, withdrawOptions, _msgFee, address(this)); 

    // *** Vulnerability: No state updates before this point! ***
}

```
Explanation of the Vulnerability:

1. External Call: The _lzSend function is an external call. It sends a message to the LayerZero network, which will eventually trigger a call to the _lzReceive function on the Solana side (potentially to a malicious contract).

2. State Not Updated: The critical flaw is that there are no state updates in the withdraw function before the _lzSend call. This means:

- The user's balance is not yet decremented.
- A nonce (if used for security) is not incremented.

3. Reentrancy Attack: An attacker can exploit this by having a malicious contract on the Solana side. When the malicious contract receives the message from _lzSend, it can immediately call back into the SolConnector.withdraw function before the original withdraw call has finished executing.

4. Exploiting Outdated State: Because no state has been updated yet, the malicious reentrant call will see the contract in the same state as before the initial withdrawal. This allows the attacker to:

- Bypass balance checks (the attacker's balance will appear sufficient).
- Reuse the same nonce (if applicable).
- Bypass any reentrancy guards.

### Attack Path

Attack Scenario

- Preparation: An attacker deploys a malicious contract on the Solana side, designed to call back into the SolConnector.withdraw function when it receives a specific cross-chain message.

- Initial Withdrawal: The attacker calls the withdraw function on the SolConnector contract, intending to withdraw some funds.

- Cross-Chain Message: The withdraw function constructs a message containing the withdrawal details and sends it to the Solana chain using _lzSend. Crucially, at this point, the contract's state (e.g., the user's balance) is not yet updated.

- Malicious Reentry: The attacker's malicious contract on Solana receives the cross-chain message. It immediately calls the withdraw function on the SolConnector contract again.

- Exploiting Outdated State: Because the SolConnector contract hasn't updated its state yet, the malicious reentrant call sees the contract as if the initial withdrawal never happened. The attacker's balance appears unchanged.

 - Bypassing Checks: The reentrant call to withdraw bypasses any checks that rely on the updated state. For example, if withdraw normally checks for sufficient balance, the reentrant call will still see the old, higher balance.

 - Repeated Withdrawals: The attacker can repeat steps 4-6 multiple times, draining funds from the SolConnector contract with each successful reentrant call.



### Impact

 vulnerability allows an attacker to steal funds directly from the SolConnector contract by repeatedly withdrawing more than their actual balance allows.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Checks: Perform all necessary checks (e.g., sufficient balance) at the beginning of the function.
Effects: Update the contract's state to reflect the withdrawal before making the _lzSend call.
Interactions: Only after updating the state, make the external call (_lzSend).
