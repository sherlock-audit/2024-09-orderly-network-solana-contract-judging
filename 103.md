# Incorrect implementation of quote instruction leads users to pay extra fees for deposits

### Summary

The USDC deposits on `solana_vault` consists of two steps:

1. User calls `quote` instruction with the deposit message and parameters. `OAppQuote` returns the LZ messaging fees for sending the deposit message.
2. User calls `deposit` with the `MessagingFee` returned by `quote` instruction and the deposit parameters.
    - The `deposit` function calls `endpoint::send` function with the deposit message and the `MessagingFee` parameters provided by the user.
 
The `quote` function uses a different LZ message options than the options used by the `deposit`. As a result, the `quote` returns higher fees than the fees required by the `deposit` function leading users to pay more fees.

### Root Cause

The `quote` function incorrectly uses `enforced_options.send_and_call` options to compute the fees while the `deposit`, which actually sends the deposit message, uses `enforced_options.send` options.

The `quote` function incorrectly uses `enforced_options.send_and_call` options:

The `params.message` will be the deposit message and it is not `None` and the `params.options` will be empty. The options are computed in the `enforced_options.combine_options` function:

The `EnforcedOptions::combine_options` returns the `send_and_call` options. The `send_and_call` options include the compose message options additional to the `send` and hence require more LZ fees than the `enforced_options.send` options.

The `deposit` instruction uses the return value of `EnforcedOptions::get_enforced_options` function as options:

The `get_enforced_options` function returns `self.send` options as the `composed_msg` parameter is set to None:

### Internal pre-conditions

No pre-conditions are required

### External pre-conditions

No pre-conditions are required

### Attack Path

Happens by itself. User uses the frontend to perform deposits.

### Impact

The users will lose funds in the form of LZ fees for every deposit on `solana_vault` by paying higher fees than required.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Update the `quote` function to use `None` for `compose_msg` argument in the call to `EnforcedOptions::combine_options`.
