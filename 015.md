# Unused Imports in `MsgCodec` Library

### Summary

The `MsgCodec` library imports three structures: `AccountDepositSol`, `AccountWithdrawSol`, and `WithdrawDataSol` from an external interface. However, only `AccountWithdrawSol` is being used in the contract, while `AccountDepositSol` and `WithdrawDataSol` are not utilized. Unused imports can lead to unnecessary gas consumption, increased code size, and reduced clarity and maintainability.

### Root Cause

The contract imports multiple structures from the `ILedger.sol` interface, but two of them (`AccountDepositSol` and `WithdrawDataSol`) are never referenced or used within the code. This results in wasted computational resources during contract compilation and deployment.

### Internal pre-conditions

The contract compiles and executes without requiring the two unused imports.


### External pre-conditions

The contract is deployed on-chain without using `AccountDepositSol` or `WithdrawDataSol`, which leads to unnecessary gas costs during deployment.

### Attack Path

This issue does not directly lead to a security exploit but results in **gas inefficiencies** and unnecessary code bloat, which could affect the contract's long-term maintainability and performance.

### Impact

1.**Gas Inefficiency** : The contract’s deployment gas cost is unnecessarily increased due to the inclusion of unused imports.

2.**Code Bloat** : Including unused imports increases the contract's size, making it harder to maintain and audit.

### PoC

To demonstrate, here’s a simplified version of the contract showing the unnecessary imports:

```solidity
// Current version
import { AccountDepositSol, AccountWithdrawSol, WithdrawDataSol } from "../interface/ILedger.sol";

// Unused: AccountDepositSol and WithdrawDataSol
```
The following steps can reproduce the issue:

1. Compile and deploy the contract.
2. Observe that `AccountDepositSol` and `WithdrawDataSol` are not referenced in the contract but are still imported.

By removing the unused imports, the contract will save on deployment costs and be cleaner:
```solidity
// Optimized version
import { AccountWithdrawSol } from "../interface/ILedger.sol"; // Only import what's used
```

### Mitigation

Remove the unused imports from the contract to optimize for gas efficiency and reduce unnecessary code complexity. The imports should only include structures that are actively used in the contract logic.

Optimized import statement:
```solidity
import { AccountWithdrawSol } from "../interface/ILedger.sol";
```
This will reduce gas consumption and improve overall code clarity, making it easier to maintain and audit the contract.
