# The account is not verified, which may lead to self-transfers and cause vault assets to inflate

### Summary

Using the `/// CHECK` annotation in conjunction with the unconstrained `AccountInfo<'info>` type bypasses Anchor's built-in security verification mechanisms, potentially triggering self-transfers and increasing the amount of USDC in the vault.

### Root Cause

In [`oapp_lz_receive.rs:31-54`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-09-orderly-network-solana-contract/blob/a40ed80ce4a196bc81bfa6dfb749c19b92c623b0/solana-vault/packages/solana/contracts/programs/solana-vault/src/instructions/oapp_instr/oapp_lz_receive.rs#L31C5-L54C60):
```Rust
   /// CHECK
    #[account()]
    pub user: AccountInfo<'info>,

    #[account(
        mut,
        associated_token::mint = deposit_token,
        associated_token::authority = user
    )]
    pub user_deposit_wallet: Account<'info, TokenAccount>,

    #[account(
        mut,
        seeds = [VAULT_AUTHORITY_SEED],
        bump = vault_authority.bump,
    )]
    pub vault_authority: Account<'info, VaultAuthority>,

    #[account(
        mut,
        associated_token::mint = deposit_token,
        associated_token::authority = vault_authority
    )]
    pub vault_deposit_wallet: Account<'info, TokenAccount>
```
creates a fake user:

`let (vault_authority, _) = Pubkey::find_program_address(&[VAULT_AUTHORITY_SEED], ctx.program_id);` 

At this time, the associated_token::authority is the same.
In [`oapp_lz_receive.rs:67-69`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-09-orderly-network-solana-contract/blob/a40ed80ce4a196bc81bfa6dfb749c19b92c623b0/solana-vault/packages/solana/contracts/programs/solana-vault/src/instructions/oapp_instr/oapp_lz_receive.rs#L67C13-L68C60):
```Rust

            from: self.vault_deposit_wallet.to_account_info(),
            to: self.user_deposit_wallet.to_account_info(),
            authority: self.vault_authority.to_account_info()

```

### Internal pre-conditions

The `user` has been set to `vault_authority`

### External pre-conditions

None

### Attack Path

1. Set `user` as `vault_authority`
2. Invoke the[`apply`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-09-orderly-network-solana-contract/blob/a40ed80ce4a196bc81bfa6dfb749c19b92c623b0/solana-vault/packages/solana/contracts/programs/solana-vault/src/instructions/oapp_instr/oapp_lz_receive.rs#L75C12-L75C17) function


### Impact

The number of USDC assets in the vault has inflated

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Verify that the `user` and ensure that the `vault_deposit_wallet` and `user_deposit_wallet` are different
