# An attacker will cause a Denial of Service for withdrawals

### Summary

The uninitialized `msgOptions` mapping in `SolConnector` will cause a Denial of Service for withdrawals as an attacker will front-run the owner to submit a withdrawal with zero gas limit, blocking all subsequent withdrawals.

### Root Cause

In [`SolConnector:92-95`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-09-orderly-network-solana-contract/blob/main/sol-cc/contracts/SolConnector.sol#L92-L95), the `initialize` function does not initialize the `msgOptions` mapping in deployment, resulting in a front run opportunity to submit zero gas and value for message type withdraw.

### Internal pre-conditions

The `SolConnector` need to be just deployed, `initialize` already called and the owner has not yet called `setOptions` to initialize `msgOptions`.

### External pre-conditions

None

### Attack Path

1. **Attacker calls** the `withdraw` function to withdraw a small amount of tokens before the owner initializes `msgOptions`.
2. **The message** takes the first nonce (`nonce = 1`) and is relayed to the Solana chain.
3. **Due to zero gas limit**, the message cannot be executed on the Solana side.
4. **The message remains unprocessed**, blocking the message queue because `order_delivery` is set to `true`.
5. **All subsequent withdrawals** are blocked since they cannot be executed before the first message with `nonce = 1`.

### Impact

The protocol suffers a Denial of Service for all withdrawals. Users cannot withdraw their tokens until the owner disables the `order_delivery` option.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Initialize the `msgOptions` mapping in the `initialize` function with appropriate gas and value for the message type withdraw to prevent zero gas limit messages.
