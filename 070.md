# Vault can be temporarily bricked by using a frozen recipient ATA when ordered delivery is enabled

### Summary

_Please note - this requires that https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-09-orderly-network-solana-contract-zilayo/issues/3 is addressed, and assumes that the intended behavior is that withdrawals are sent to the specified recipient on Solana rather than any arbitrary recipient  (current behavior)._

When Ordered Delivery is enabled, this requires that messages received/sent are sequentially ordered by nonce.

In the event that a recipient ATA is frozen by the mint freeze authority (Circle assuming USDC), this will result in `solana_vault::lz_receive` reverting, which will fail to increment the `vault_authority.inbound_nonce`. Pending cross chain messages with later nonces cannot be processed as the below invariant fails:

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-09-orderly-network-solana-contract/blob/main/solana-vault/packages/solana/contracts/programs/solana-vault/src/instructions/oapp_instr/oapp_lz_receive.rs#L94-L102

_Note - although the above if statement can be false, the `01setup_oapp.ts` script set this as an enforced option for sending, and `04_setup_vault.ts` sets this to true for receiving when initializing the vault, so it’s likely that ordered execution is intended._

### Root Cause

In `solana_vault::instructions::oapp_instr::oapp_lz_receive`, the vault expects that LayerZero messages are processed sequentially by nonce when `order_delivery` is enabled. 

An attacker can send a valid message from Orderly that fails to execute on Solana due to the token account being frozen. This results in messages with later nonces being impossible to execute, and user funds that have been withdrawn on the source chain (Orderly) state being non receivable on the destination chain (Solana).

When the Solana Token Program executes a transfer it checks that neither the source nor destination accounts are frozen

```rust
 if source_account.is_frozen() || destination_account.is_frozen() {
            return Err(TokenError::AccountFrozen.into());
        }
```

Circle, as the USDC freeze authority, occasionally freezes accounts. An attacker just needs to submit a withdrawal request where the recipient token account on Solana is one which Circle has blacklisted. In this scenario, the `transfer` call in `solana_vault::lz_receive(...)` will revert.

### Internal pre-conditions

Issue https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-09-orderly-network-solana-contract-zilayo/issues/3 needs to be addressed.

It assumes that the intended behavior is that the `user_deposit_wallet` account passed to `solana_vault::lz_receive` has the same pubkey as the`_withdrawData.receiver` specified in `SolConnector`

### External pre-conditions

### Attack Path

1. Attacker deposits funds into the vault. This gives them a balance on Orderly / the CeFi platform.

2. Attacker initiates an off-chain action on Orderly / CeFi platform such as a withdrawal request. In this instance, the requested recipient is a Solana USDC ATA which is frozen by Circle. The Orderly operator picks this up and after a series of contract calls, the message is sent to LayerZero, with the `_withdrawData.receiver` being included in the `lzWithdrawMsg`.
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-09-orderly-network-solana-contract/blob/main/sol-cc/contracts/SolConnector.sol#L97

3. LayerZero picks this up and it is validated via `LayerZero::endpoint::init_verify(...)`, which creates a PayloadHash account that will later be used and closed during `solana_vault::lz_receive(...)`

4. Once validated by LayerZero, a relayer calls `solana_vault::lz_receive(...)`. Assuming issue https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-09-orderly-network-solana-contract-zilayo/issues/3 is addressed, it checks that the provided `user_deposit_wallet` pubkey is the same as the decoded withdraw receiver.

5. The `solana_vault` program attempts to CPI into the Token Program to transfer USDC to the `user_deposit_wallet`. Since this is frozen, the transfer instruction will fail, resulting in the entire transaction failing.



### Impact

Future withdrawals will be stuck as it requires that the attacker's message with nonce n is executed before messages with nonce n+1, n+2, n+3, etc can be processed.

Users will have their balances on Orderly / the CeFi app deducted, but will be unable to receive anything on the Solana side.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

If ordered delivery is required, perhaps this could be split up into 2 separate instructions instead of a single `lz_receive` instruction.

The logic of checking and updating the `vault_authority.inbound_nonce`, and the `Clear` CPI would be handled in one instruction - this ensures that the nonce is always incremented for successfully verified messages. It could create a new `VerifiedWithdrawal` PDA which stores data such as the nonce, token amount, token recipient, etc.

Then the actual transfer logic can be handled in another instruction. This would accept the `VerifiedWithdrawal` PDA and deserialize it to get the token amount + recipient. Upon successful execution of this instruction it would then close the `VerifiedWithdrawal` PDA.

This approach would ensure that the `inbound_nonce` is always updated for successfully verified packets, and then any transfer failures would have no impact on later messages.


### Additional Note

Please note, this *may* also true when initiating a deposit from Solana → Orderly as `SolConnector.sol` expects that transactions are processed sequentially when `orderDelivery` is enabled (enabled by default).

There doesn’t seem to be a publicly available version of the Ledger contract implementing the `accountDepositSol` function so it’s unclear what occurs during this call. If it attempts to transfer USDC to the user provided `userAddress` , then the receive call will revert and fail to update the `inboundNonce` if the address is blacklisted.
