# Gas could get stuck in the contract

### Summary

User could lose the extra gas fee they sent due to incorrect return value in _payNative function.



### Root Cause

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-09-orderly-network-solana-contract/blob/main/sol-cc/contracts/layerzerolabs/lz-evm-oapp-v2/contracts/oapp/OAppSenderUpgradeable.sol#L110-L114
The _payNative function has the following check :

    function _payNative(uint256 _nativeFee) internal virtual returns (uint256 nativeFee) {
        // enable the OApp to pay the native fee
        if (msg.value < _nativeFee && address(this).balance < _nativeFee) revert NotEnoughNative(msg.value);
        return _nativeFee; //@audit should return msg.value so that the extra gas gets refunded to the user
    }

As the function has `&&` not `||` the user will provide the required gas fee, so the extra fee (_nativeFee - msg.value) paid by the user will get stuck in the contract.


### Internal pre-conditions

None

### External pre-conditions

None

### Impact

User loses the entitled refund of gas fee.

### Mitigation

Refund the extra fee (_nativeFee - msg.value) paid by the user.
