# Malicious user user can aviod paying LZ fees and steal other users excess fees

### Summary

Due to wrong check in `OAppSenderUpgradeable._payNative()`, malicious user can aviod paying LZ fees and steal other users excess fees - he can send `msg.value = 0`, but the transaction will not revert, because the excess fees of other users accumulated on the contract balance will be used to pay for the cross-chain message.

### Root Cause

[Link](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-09-orderly-network-solana-contract/blob/a40ed80ce4a196bc81bfa6dfb749c19b92c623b0/sol-cc/contracts/layerzerolabs/lz-evm-oapp-v2/contracts/oapp/OAppSenderUpgradeable.sol#L112)
This line should check if the user has sent enough funds to pay cross-chain gas fee:
```solidity
if (msg.value < _nativeFee && address(this).balance < _nativeFee) revert NotEnoughNative(msg.value);
```
But a second check is also performed - whether the balance of the contract is greater than the fees, and these two checks are connected by a logical `AND`.
This `if` block will revert only if both conditions are **true**.
But if `msg.value` = 0, and `address(this).balance` >= `_nativeFee`, meaning **true** and **false**, then contitions for revert will not meet.

Next, lets see at `_payNative()` function - amount that will be sent to Endpoint does not depend on `msg.value`, meaning that message can be executed even if user sends 0 amount of fees:
```solidity
function _payNative(uint256 _nativeFee) internal virtual returns (uint256 nativeFee) {
        // enable the OApp to pay the native fee
        if (msg.value < _nativeFee && address(this).balance < _nativeFee) revert NotEnoughNative(msg.value);
        return _nativeFee;
    }
```
Balance of `address(this)` can be greater than `nativeFee`, because the contract holds excess fees, that was not refunded to users.


### Internal pre-conditions

Balance of `address(this)` needs to be greater than `nativeFee`. It's possible because the contract holds excess fees, that was not refunded to users. Users always need to overpay the fee to send message, because cross-chain gas fees are dynamic. But due to some reasons, excess fees refunded to `address(this)`, and malicious user can steal them.


### External pre-conditions

None.

### Attack Path

1. Other users make cross-chain withdrawals, and excess fees are accumulated on the contract balance, `address(this).balance = 1000`.
2. Amelie observes until the contract balance is sufficient to cover LZ fees, `_nativeFee = 900`.
3. Amelie makes a withdrawal request and sends `msg.value = 0`, i.e. does not pay any fees.
4. `(msg.value < _nativeFee && address(this).balance < _nativeFee)` = `(0 < 900 && 1000 < 900)` = `true && false`.
5. Withdrawal request is successful because there was no revert in `_payNative()` and the excess fees belonging to other users were used for paying cross-chain gas fees.

### Impact

Other users lost excess fees belonging to them, malicious user avoided paying LayerZero fees and lost nothing.

### PoC

See _Attack Path_.

### Mitigation

Always make sure that `msg.value >= _nativeFee`:
```diff
 function _payNative(uint256 _nativeFee) internal virtual returns (uint256 nativeFee) {
        // enable the OApp to pay the native fee
-        if (msg.value < _nativeFee && address(this).balance < _nativeFee) revert NotEnoughNative(msg.value);
+        if (msg.value < _nativeFee || address(this).balance < _nativeFee) revert NotEnoughNative(msg.value);
        return _nativeFee;
    }
```
