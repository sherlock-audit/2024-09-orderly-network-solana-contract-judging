# Old admin keeps the delegate role after transferring the admin role

### Summary

Transferring admin does not update delegate on the Layer Zero endpoint, which will cause that the old admin will still have delegate privileges over the bridge.

### Root Cause

When the `OAppConfig` is initialized, the delegate is set to be the current admin ([see here](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-09-orderly-network-solana-contract/blob/main/solana-vault/packages/solana/contracts/programs/solana-vault/src/state/oapp_state/oapp_config.rs#L33-L40)).

However, the delegate is not updated if [`reinit_oapp`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-09-orderly-network-solana-contract/blob/main/solana-vault/packages/solana/contracts/programs/solana-vault/src/instructions/oapp_instr/reinit_oapp.rs#L29) or [`transfer_admin`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-09-orderly-network-solana-contract/blob/main/solana-vault/packages/solana/contracts/programs/solana-vault/src/instructions/oapp_instr/transfer_admin.rs#L19) is called, leaving the old admin as the delegate.

### Internal pre-conditions

1. Vault Authority owner calls `reinit_oapp` or OApp Admin calls `transfer_admin`,

### External pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

Delegate role of the OApp can perform certain critical actions regarding the OApp.

### Impact

Old admin has delegate role in Layer Zero OApp after admin was updated and can misbehave.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Consider explicitly changing the delegate when the `OAppConfig` admin is changed.
