# A malicious user can withdrawals another user's money

### Summary

A shared vault authority signing mechanism will cause unauthorized withdrawals for users, as User A can withdraw funds belonging to User B.

### Root Cause
In the [OAppLzReceive](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-09-orderly-network-solana-contract/blob/a40ed80ce4a196bc81bfa6dfb749c19b92c623b0/solana-vault/packages/solana/contracts/programs/solana-vault/src/instructions/oapp_instr/oapp_lz_receive.rs#L113-L114), the `vault_authority_seeds` are shared across all users, allowing any user with valid withdrawal parameters to use the same PDA signing authority. As a result, any valid withdrawal request can be signed by the vault without distinguishing which user is performing the withdrawal. 

Also, there is no check that the wallet receiving the funds belongs to the same user for whom the withdrawal request was initiated. The system only checks that the withdrawal message comes from a valid sender (peer.address == params.sender), but does not verify that the user account corresponds to the sender.

### External pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

1. User B initiates a withdrawal on the Ethereum side and a valid withdraw message is sent to the Solana. 
2. User A accesses the valid withdrawal messages corresponding to User B's account and calls the function before User B.
3. Since there is no check to ensure the User A uses a withdrawal message corresponding to his account, the withdraw is successfully executed and User A steals User B's money.

### Impact

The attacker steals the entire withdrawn amount from User B's account without any corresponding loss.
