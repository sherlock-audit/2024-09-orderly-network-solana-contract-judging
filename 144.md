# sequential messaging in oapp_lz_receive can be easily attacked

### Summary

`oapp_lz_receive.rs` uses sequential messaging when receiving messages through `lzReceive()`. If `vault_authority.order_delivery` is turned on, messages can only come in order.

There are a few ways the messaging sequence can fail, such as:
1. Having too little tokens in `vault_deposit_wallet`.
2. `user_deposit_wallet` not initialized.
3. If either accounts are frozen.
4. Too little gas available.

When the messaging sequence fail, other messages cannot pass, making the whole messaging system fail.

### Root Cause

In [oapp_lz_receive.apply](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-09-orderly-network-solana-contract/blob/main/solana-vault/packages/solana/contracts/programs/solana-vault/src/instructions/oapp_instr/oapp_lz_receive.rs#L94), one of the params of `OAppLzReceiveParams` is `nonce`. This nonce is used when `order_delivery` is set to true.

```rust
        if ctx.accounts.vault_authority.order_delivery {
            require!(
                params.nonce == ctx.accounts.vault_authority.inbound_nonce + 1,
                OAppError::InvalidInboundNonce
            );
        }
```

In the [LayerZero](https://github.com/LayerZero-Labs/devtools/blob/9b70e96248fcb4d8772678ea7c4b74da6cc2bc0e/examples/oft-solana/programs/oft/src/instructions/lz_receive.rs#L73) example, nonce is not used for sequential messaging.

### Internal pre-conditions

_No response_

### External pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

_No response_

### Impact

If one message fails, all subsequent messages cannot be read.

Setting severity as Medium as `order_delivery` can always be turned off.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Best is to allow out of order execution as messaging sequence can be easily disrupted.
