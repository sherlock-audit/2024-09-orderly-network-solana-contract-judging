# A user can double withdraw after a vault reinitialization

### Summary

If a vault is reinitialized, it may lead to a scenario where an old withdrawal is attempted. This situation can occur due to the reset of the vault's state, creating the potential for a double withdrawal.



### Root Cause

The potential issue arises from the fact that the vault reinitialization process allows for the resetting of key parameters, including the `inbound_nonce`. If this nonce is reset without considering previous transactions, the system might fail to identify duplicate withdrawals. 

In the [OAppLzReceive::apply](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-09-orderly-network-solana-contract/blob/02396b61f6e77008d8d24c8b84f65644b20f445e/solana-vault/packages/solana/contracts/programs/solana-vault/src/instructions/oapp_instr/oapp_lz_receive.rs#L94-L99) function, the check to prevent nonce duplication is as follows:

```js
require!(
    params.nonce == ctx.accounts.vault_authority.inbound_nonce + 1,
    OAppError::InvalidInboundNonce
);
```

### Attack Path

1. A user initiates a withdrawal with nonce 5, and the funds are transferred successfully.
2. The vault's `inbound_nonce` is updated to track this withdrawal.
3. The vault is reinitialized, which resets parameters such as the `deposit_nonce`, `inbound_nonce`, and other vault configurations. If the inbound nonce is not properly retained or reset to a correct state, the system may not recognize the prior withdrawal.
4. After reinitialization, a the old withdrawal request with nonce 5 is submitted. The code will mistakenly process this withdrawal again, leading to double withdrawal.

### Impact

A user can withdrawal twice due to a reset `inbound_nonce`, and the user could withdraw funds that they have already received.
