# Cross-Chain Balance Invariant Vulnerability in Orderly Network's LayerZero Configuration Due to Reorg

### Summary

Orderly Network's default LayerZero configuration without DVN usage can cause a balance mismatch between Solana and Orderly Chain as chain reorgs can result in withdrawals being executed on Solana while being reverted on Orderly Chain.


### Root Cause

LayerZero's documentation recommends using DVN configuration, which includes a crucial 'confirmations' parameter allowing protocols to specify the number of blocks to wait before message delivery. The choice not to utilize this configuration to wait for L1 finality in Orderly Network's cross-chain messaging creates a vulnerability, as messages can be delivered before source chain state is final. In the event of an L1 reorganization, this premature delivery can result in inconsistent balances between Solana and Orderly Chain, as withdrawal messages may be processed on Solana before the L1 state (and consequently the L2 state) is finalized.

This will result in breaking of the invariant specified in README
> What properties/invariants do you want to hold even if breaking them has a low/unknown impact?
The USDC balance of Vault pgram on Solana is no less than the Vault balance record on Ledger contract on Orderly chain

### Internal pre-conditions

_No response_

### External pre-conditions

1. L1 chain must undergo a block reorganization after the LayerZero message delivery
2. Reorg depth must exceed the default confirmation settings of LayerZero
3. Orderly Chain (L2) must reorganize its state following the L1 reorg

### Attack Path

1. User initiates legitimate withdrawal on Orderly Chain
2. LayerZero processes the withdrawal message with default confirmation settings
3. Message is relayed to Solana Vault before L1 finality
4. Solana Vault releases USDC based on the message
5. L1 block containing the Orderly withdrawal undergoes reorg
6. Orderly Chain state is reorged, erasing the withdrawal record
7. System enters inconsistent state with Orderly Chain balance exceeding Solana Vault holding

### Impact

Orderly Network suffers a critical balance invariant violation where the Solana Vault holds less USDC than recorded in Orderly Chain's Ledger contract.
