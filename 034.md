# Race Condition leading to double deposit

### Summary

The Deposit::apply function has a race condition because the deposit_nonce is incremented after the token transfer is executed. This creates a window of vulnerability where an attacker can potentially trigger two deposit operations concurrently, both using the same deposit_nonce.



### Root Cause

Token Transfer First: The transfer() function executes the actual transfer of tokens from the user's account to the vault's account. This is the critical action that changes the state of funds.

Nonce Increment After: The deposit_nonce is incremented after the transfer() call. This is the root of the race condition.

```rust 
impl<'info> Deposit<'info> {
    // ... other code ...

    pub fn apply(
        ctx: &mut Context<'_, '_, '_, 'info, Deposit<'info>>,
        deposit_params: &DepositParams,
        oapp_params: &OAppSendParams,
    ) -> Result<MessagingReceipt> {
        transfer(
            ctx.accounts.transfer_token_ctx(),
            deposit_params.token_amount,
        )?;

        msg!("User deposited : {}", deposit_params.token_amount);

        // *** VULNERABILITY: Nonce incremented AFTER token transfer ***
        ctx.accounts.vault_authority.deposit_nonce += 1; 

        // ... rest of the code ...
    }
}

```

### Attack Path

Attack Scenario

1. Preparation: An attacker prepares two deposit transactions with identical parameters, including the same account_id, token_amount, and deposit_nonce.

2. Concurrent Execution: The attacker submits both transactions to the network almost simultaneously, exploiting the asynchronous nature of blockchain transactions.

Race Condition:

- Transaction 1: Reads the current deposit_nonce from the vault_authority account.
- Transaction 2: Also reads the same deposit_nonce value from the vault_authority account, as it hasn't been incremented yet.
- Transaction 1: Executes the token transfer, successfully depositing the tokens.
- Transaction 2: Also executes the token transfer, using the same deposit_nonce as Transaction 1, effectively depositing the tokens a second time.
- Transaction 1: Increments the deposit_nonce.
- Transaction 2: Increments the deposit_nonce again, but it's already too late.
3. Double Deposit: The attacker has successfully deposited the same amount of tokens twice using the same nonce, effectively doubling their deposit.



### Impact

Double Deposits: Attackers can deposit tokens multiple times using the same nonce, potentially inflating their balance or disrupting the intended functionality of the vault.

### Mitigation

The solution is to increment the deposit_nonce before executing the token transfer. This ensures that each deposit operation has a unique nonce, even if they occur concurrently.

```rust
impl<'info> Deposit<'info> {
    // ... other code ...

    pub fn apply(
        ctx: &mut Context<'_, '_, '_, 'info, Deposit<'info>>,
        deposit_params: &DepositParams,
        oapp_params: &OAppSendParams,
    ) -> Result<MessagingReceipt> {
        // Increment deposit_nonce before the token transfer
        ctx.accounts.vault_authority.deposit_nonce += 1;

        transfer(
            ctx.accounts.transfer_token_ctx(),
            deposit_params.token_amount,
        )?;

        // ... rest of the code ...
    }
}

```
By incrementing the nonce first, you eliminate the race condition and ensure that each deposit operation has a unique identifier, preventing double deposits.
