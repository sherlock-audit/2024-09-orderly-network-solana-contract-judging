# When a PDA (Program Derived Address) is required to perform signing operations but invoke_signed is not used, the transaction will fail

### Summary

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-09-orderly-network-solana-contract/blob/main/solana-vault/packages/solana/contracts/programs/solana-vault/src/instructions/oapp_instr/init_oapp.rs#L31
 your apply function, you are attempting to call the init method of oapp_config and passing oapp_signer as the signer:
``` rust
let oapp_signer = ctx.accounts.oapp_config.key();
ctx.accounts.oapp_config.init(
    params.endpoint_program,
    params.admin,
    ctx.remaining_accounts,
    oapp_signer,
)
``` 
However, the PDA (Program Derived Address), which is the address of oapp_config, cannot directly sign transactions because it does not have a private key. To enable a PDA to sign operations that require a signature, you must use the invoke_signed method and provide the correct seed and bump values.

### Mitigation

In the init method of oapp_config, ensure that youâ€™re using invoke_signed to perform actions that require the PDA to sign.
