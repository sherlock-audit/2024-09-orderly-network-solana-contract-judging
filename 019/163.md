# Zero-amount deposits will cause an underflow on withdrawal

### Summary

Users can make zero-amount deposits, leading to an arithmetic underflow in the withdrawal logic. When a withdrawal is attempted, the function calculates `amount_to_transfer` by `subtracting withdraw_params.fee` from `withdraw_params.token_amount`. With `token_amount` set to zero, this results in a negative outcome, which causes an underflow.

### Root Cause

There is no validation to ensure that the deposit amount is greater than zero, nor is there a check to prevent withdrawal if the amount is insufficient to cover fees, which can cause an underflow. When the [amount_to_transfer](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-09-orderly-network-solana-contract/blob/a40ed80ce4a196bc81bfa6dfb749c19b92c623b0/solana-vault/packages/solana/contracts/programs/solana-vault/src/instructions/oapp_instr/oapp_lz_receive.rs#L117) is calculated, `withdraw_params.token_amount` (which may be zero) has `withdraw_params.fee` subtracted from it. This subtraction leads to an underflow if `token_amount` is zero.
