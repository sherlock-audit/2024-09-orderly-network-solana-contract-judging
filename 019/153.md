# Missing Fee Validation in Token Withdrawal

### Summary

The  token withdrawal implementation lacks proper validation of fee amounts against token amounts, which could lead to arithmetic underflow and potential loss of funds.

### Root Cause

In the `oapp_lz_receive.rs:117` the withdrawl logic performs unchecked substraction:

### Internal pre-conditions

1. `VaultAuthority `needs to be initialized with proper PDA seeds and bump
2. `user_deposit_wallet` and `vault_deposit_wallet` need to be properly initialized Associated Token Accounts
3. `Vault` needs to have sufficient token balance to process withdrawals

### External pre-conditions

1. LayerZero message needs to be properly formatted and contain withdrawal parameters
2. Cross-chain message needs to be successfully delivered and processed by LayerZero endpoint

### Attack Path

1. Attacker crafts a malicious LayerZero message with `fee` greater than  `token_amount`
2. Message is sent through LayerZero to solana chain
3. Message arrives and passes message validation checks
4. Withdrawal processing begins and attempts to subtract fee from token amount
5. This scenario occurs:  If fee > token_amount: Arithmetic underflow causes transaction to fail or withdraw more from the vault


### Impact

The protocol suffers a critical loss of funds due to arithmetic underflow in `amount_to_transfer` calculation. When `fee` > `token_amount`, the subtraction operation `token_amount - fee` will underflow , resulting in a very large number . 
Example:

If t`oken_amount` = 100 and` fee` = 101
`amount_to_transfer = token_amount - fee`
In u64:` 100 - 101 `underflows to `18446744073709551615` (2^64 - 1)
The attacker can withdraw this massive amount of tokens from the vault
