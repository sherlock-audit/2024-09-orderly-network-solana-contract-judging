# Order Delivery Logic

### Summary

The setOrderDelivery function allows the owner to change the order delivery mode and reset the nonce:
```solidity
orderDelivery = _orderDelivery;
inboundNonce = _inboundNonce;
```
This appears to reset the nonce arbitrarily. Be cautious when resetting the nonce as it could cause issues if messages arrive out of order or an attacker tries to manipulate the order. Additional safety mechanisms might be needed, especially in multi-chain environments.
