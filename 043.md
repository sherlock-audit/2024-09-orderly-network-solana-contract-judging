# Loss of funds as there is no withdraw function for the Ether in the contract

### Summary

There is no function to withdraw the Ether sent to the contract, which will lock it into the contract and there is a loss of funds. 

### Root Cause

In [SolConnector.sol](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-09-orderly-network-solana-contract/blob/02396b61f6e77008d8d24c8b84f65644b20f445e/sol-cc/contracts/SolConnector.sol#L19), the refund address is set to `address(this)` when sending messages using `_lzSend`, causing any excess Ether to be refunded back to the contract. However, there is no function to withdraw the Ether from the contract, leading to a permanent lock of any refunded Ether in the contract.
