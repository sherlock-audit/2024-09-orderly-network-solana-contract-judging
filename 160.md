# reset instructions will not work

### Summary

The reset instruction first assigns the ownership of the PDA to System and then tries to `realloc` its size to zero. This is not possible as after assigning ownership to System, only System will have the rights to do this.

### Root Cause

After the ownership of PDA is assigned to System, no account other than System can change its size.
This issue exists in both `reset_oapp.rs` and `reset_vault.rs`:

### Mitigation

Here is a recommended way to close accounts:
```rust
#[program]
pub mod closing_accounts_recommended {
    use super::*;

    pub fn close(ctx: Context<Close>) -> ProgramResult {
        Ok(())
    }
}

#[derive(Accounts)]
pub struct Close<'info> {
    #[account(mut, close = destination)]
    account: Account<'info, Data>,
    #[account(mut)]
    destination: AccountInfo<'info>,
}

#[account]
pub struct Data {
    data: u64,
}
```
`close` constraint will make it so that the account is deleted and remaining SOL is sent to destination, after this you can initialize PDA as usual.
