# Incorrect Nonce Verification

### Summary

The _checkPacketSizeAndOrder function in the PreCrime contract is designed to ensure that incoming packets are processed in the correct order. It does this by checking the nonce associated with each packet. However, there's a subtle but critical flaw in the nonce verification logic

### Root Cause
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-09-orderly-network-solana-contract/blob/main/sol-cc/contracts/layerzerolabs/lz-evm-oapp-v2/contracts/precrime/PreCrime.sol#L163C1-L164C1

```solidity 
// ... inside _checkPacketSizeAndOrder ...

if (packet.origin.nonce != ++nonce) revert PacketUnsorted(); 

```

The problem lies in the use of the pre-increment operator (++nonce). This operator increments the nonce variable before the comparison with packet.origin.nonce takes place.

1. With ++nonce: The nonce is incremented before the comparison. This means if a packet arrives with a nonce that's one less than expected, the check will still pass incorrectly.

Example:

nonce is 5.
A packet arrives with packet.origin.nonce = 4.
++nonce increments nonce to 6.
The comparison 4 != 6 is true, so the check passes, even though the packet is out of order.


2. With nonce++: The nonce is incremented after the comparison. This ensures that the comparison is done with the correct expected nonce value.

Example:

nonce is 5.
A packet arrives with packet.origin.nonce = 4.
The comparison 4 != 5 is false, so the check correctly fails, as the packet is out of order.
nonce++ increments nonce to 6 for the next packet.

#### Therefore, using ++nonce in this context is a bug because it allows out-of-order packets to be processed, potentially leading to state inconsistencies and replay attacks. The correct fix is to use nonce++

### Attack Path

Attack Scenario

Legitimate Packet: A valid packet with nonce = 5 is sent to the PreCrime contract. The contract processes it, and the internal nonce is incremented to 6.

Malicious Replay: An attacker intercepts an older packet that was already processed, with nonce = 4.

Exploiting the Flaw: The attacker replays this older packet. Due to the pre-increment in the _checkPacketSizeAndOrder function, the check 4 != 7 (nonce is incremented to 7 before comparison) still passes, even though the packet is out of order.

Consequences: The replayed packet is processed again, potentially causing unintended state changes, double-spending, or other undesirable effects, depending on the logic of the _simulate and _preCrime functions.

### Impact

Impact: Out-of-Order Packet Processing and Replay Attacks

This seemingly minor error can have significant consequences:

Out-of-Order Packets: Due to the pre-increment, a packet with a nonce that's one less than the expected nonce will still pass the check. This means packets can be processed out of order.

State Inconsistencies: If the order of packets is crucial for the correct execution of the _simulate and _preCrime functions (which handle the actual logic of the contract), processing them out of order can lead to incorrect state updates, unexpected behavior, and potential vulnerabilities.

Replay Attacks: An attacker could replay older packets that have already been processed. Since the nonce check is flawed, these replayed packets might be accepted if their nonce is just one behind the current expected nonce.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

The solution is straightforward: replace the pre-increment operator (++nonce) with the post-increment operator (nonce++). This ensures that the comparison with packet.origin.nonce happens before the nonce variable is incremented.

```solidity
// ... inside _checkPacketSizeAndOrder ...

if (packet.origin.nonce != nonce++) revert PacketUnsorted(); 

```
