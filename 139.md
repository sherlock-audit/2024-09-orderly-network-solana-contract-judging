# Missing Authorization Check for Peer Modification.

## Summary


The Rate limit params is vulnerable to  unauthorized peer modification due to a missing authorization check.


## Vulnerability Detail
In the SetRateLimit instruction, the peer account is modified without verifying if the admin has permission to modify the specific peer. The oapp_config account has a has_one constraint ensuring only the authorized admin can modify it, but this check is absent for the peer account.

## Proof of Concept


## Impact

Unauthorized Rate Limit Modification: An attacker can exploit this vulnerability to set arbitrary rate limits for any peer, potentially disrupting the systems traffic management.

##  Tool used
Manual Review

## Recommendation


1. Add a has_one constraint to the peer account ensuring only authorized admins or the peer's owner can modify it.
2. 
3. Implement an additional check verifying the admin's permission to modify the specific peer before allowing the modification.

code modification:


#[derive(Accounts)]
#[instruction(params: SetRateLimitParams)]
pub struct SetRateLimit<'info> {
    pub admin: Signer<'info>,
    #[account(
        mut,
        seeds = [PEER_SEED, &oapp_config.key().to_bytes(), &params.dst_eid.to_be_bytes()],
        bump,
        has_one = admin // or peer_owner, if peer_owner is a separate account
    )]
    pub peer: Account<'info, Peer>,
    #[account(
        seeds = [OAPP_SEED],
        bump = oapp_config.bump,
        has_one = admin @OAppError::Unauthorized
    )]
    pub oapp_config: Account<'info, OAppConfig>,
}
