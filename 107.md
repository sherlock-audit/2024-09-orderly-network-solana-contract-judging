# Incorrect Constraint in SetPeer Hinders Admin Updates During Peer Changes

### Summary
An admin cannot update the `dst_eid` to a new peer address via the [`set_peer`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-09-orderly-network-solana-contract/blob/a40ed80ce4a196bc81bfa6dfb749c19b92c623b0/solana-vault/packages/solana/contracts/programs/solana-vault/src/lib.rs#L100-L102) function due to the incorrect use of the `init` constraint on the `peer` account.

### Root Cause
In cases of misconfigurations or code bugs, the destination chain may switch to a new peer or SolConnector. When this happens, the [`set_peer`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-09-orderly-network-solana-contract/blob/a40ed80ce4a196bc81bfa6dfb749c19b92c623b0/solana-vault/packages/solana/contracts/programs/solana-vault/src/lib.rs#L100-L102) function is intended to be called by the admin to update the `dst_eid` to the new peer address. However, because `init` is used, the call will always fail as it attempts to reinitialize an already initialized account, making it impossible to update the peer address.

### Internal Preconditions
None

### External Preconditions
None

### Attack Path
None

### Impact
If the `dst_eid` peer changes, it will be impossible to switch to the new peer.

### Mitigation
Update [`SetPeer::peer`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-09-orderly-network-solana-contract/blob/a40ed80ce4a196bc81bfa6dfb749c19b92c623b0/solana-vault/packages/solana/contracts/programs/solana-vault/src/instructions/oapp_instr/set_peer.rs#L11-L18) to:
```rust
    #[account(
+        init_if_needed,
        payer = admin,
        space = 8 + Peer::INIT_SPACE,
        seeds = [PEER_SEED, &oapp_config.key().to_bytes(), &params.dst_eid.to_be_bytes()],
        bump
    )]
    pub peer: Account<'info, Peer>,
```
