# Ledger never calls SolConnector's `withdraw()`

### Summary

The Ledger is a singleton contract in the Orderly Protocol and it is the only contract that can call SolConnector's [`withdraw()`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-09-orderly-network-solana-contract/blob/main/sol-cc/contracts/SolConnector.sol#L77). However, the Ledger only [calls `withdraw()`](https://github.com/OrderlyNetwork/contract-evm/blob/main/src/LedgerImplA.sol#L177) on the CrossChainManager.

### Root Cause

The Ledger is not configured to send calls to `SolConnector`. 

ref: [LedgerImplA.executeWithdrawAction():177](https://github.com/OrderlyNetwork/contract-evm/blob/main/src/LedgerImplA.sol#L177)
```solidity
ILedgerCrossChainManager(crossChainManagerAddress).withdraw(withdraw);
```

### Internal pre-conditions

_No response_

### External pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

1. SolConnector's `withdraw()` will never be called until Ledger is modified.

### Impact

Withdrawing from SolanaVault will not be possible until Ledger is fixed.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Consider modifying Ledger's [implementation](https://github.com/OrderlyNetwork/contract-evm/blob/main/src/LedgerImplA.sol#L177) to call `SolConnector` when withdrawing from Solana.
