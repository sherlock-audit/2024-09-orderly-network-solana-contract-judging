# admin cannot sweep left over assets in solconnector

### Summary

admin cannot sweep left over assets in solconnector

### Root Cause

solconnector contract should send native token or lztoken as fee to layerzero's endpoint but withdraw function isn't payable its mean msg.value always is zero and solconnector should has enough balance to pay fee and as I understood they should send ether directly to solconnector contract but problem is here there is no way to sweep remaining native tokens in solconnecor, hence left over native tokens stuck in solconnector contract
