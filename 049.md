# User funds can become temporarily unavailable when Solana components are being reset

### Summary

Users being able to transact while the Solana part of the application is unavailable will cause a temporary fund unavailability as `SolConnector` does not implement `Pausable`.

### Root Cause

The choice to not implement `whenNotPaused` checks in `SolConnector` is a mistake, as users will be able to transact while the Solana part of the application is unavailable.

### Internal pre-conditions

1. Admin needs to call [`reset_oapp`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-09-orderly-network-solana-contract/blob/main/solana-vault/packages/solana/contracts/programs/solana-vault/src/instructions/oapp_instr/reset_oapp.rs) or [`reset_vault`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-09-orderly-network-solana-contract/blob/main/solana-vault/packages/solana/contracts/programs/solana-vault/src/instructions/vault_instr/reset_vault.rs) on the Solana part of the application to reset one of these accounts.

### External pre-conditions

None

### Attack Path

1. User calls `withdraw` on the Orderly network to trigger a withdrawal on the Solana chain
2. Since the cross-chain message can not be received as the receive call expects data from the accounts that were reset ([see here](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-09-orderly-network-solana-contract/blob/main/solana-vault/packages/solana/contracts/programs/solana-vault/src/instructions/oapp_instr/oapp_lz_receive.rs#L26-L47)), their funds will be unavailable until the accounts are reinitialized

### Impact

The user cannot access their funds until the reset accounts are reinitialized.

### PoC

[Pausable inherited](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-09-orderly-network-solana-contract/blob/main/sol-cc/contracts/layerzerolabs/lz-evm-oapp-v2/contracts/oapp/OAppUpgradeable.sol#L22) but not used.


### Mitigation

Consider decorating the `withdraw` call with `whenNotPaused` modifier.
