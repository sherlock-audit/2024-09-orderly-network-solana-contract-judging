# Ethereum messaging failure could lock user funds in Solana vault

### Summary

A failure in receiving the deposit message on the Ethereum side will cause funds to be stuck in the Solana Vault for users, as the user's deposit will not be recorded on Ethereum, preventing future withdrawal attempts.

### Root Cause

In the [deposit](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-09-orderly-network-solana-contract/blob/02396b61f6e77008d8d24c8b84f65644b20f445e/solana-vault/packages/solana/contracts/programs/solana-vault/src/instructions/vault_instr/deposit.rs#L107-L166) of the Solana contract, after transferring funds to the Solana Vault, a message is sent to Ethereum to record the deposit. If the message is not received on Ethereum, the deposit will not be recorded, and as a result, the user won't be able to initiate a withdrawal since Ethereum won't recognize the deposited amount.

### Internal pre-conditions

1. User initiates a deposit, transferring tokens to the Solana Vault.
2. Solana contract sends a deposit message to the Ethereum contract.
3. Ethereum fails to process or receive the deposit message due to a network or contract error.

### External pre-conditions

1. Ethereum network experiences an outage or high congestion, causing messages from Solana to fail or be delayed.
2. LayerZero communication between Solana and Ethereum fails due to message-handling problem.

### Attack Path

_No response_

### Impact

The user will experience a loss of funds, as their funds will be locked in the Solana Vault without a corresponding record on the Ethereum side. The user's funds in the vault will remain inaccessible, and no withdrawal can be made until the Ethereum side acknowledges the deposit message.
If `order_delivery` is true, this will also affect the users withdraws after the victim as withdrawals are in sequence.
