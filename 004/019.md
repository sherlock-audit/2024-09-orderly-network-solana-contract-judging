# No way to recover withdrawal fees

### Summary

Fees are taken when a withdrawal request is fulfilled, but the protocl introduces no way of retrieving these fees.

### Root Cause

The withdrawal payload to send to solana contains a fee parameter.

```solidity
    function encodeWithdrawPayload(
        AccountWithdrawSol memory _withdrawSolData
    ) internal pure returns (bytes memory withdrawSolPayload) {
        withdrawSolPayload = abi.encodePacked(
            bytes32(_withdrawSolData.accountId),
            bytes32(_withdrawSolData.sender),
            bytes32(_withdrawSolData.receiver),
            bytes32(_withdrawSolData.brokerHash),
            bytes32(_withdrawSolData.tokenHash),
            uint64(_withdrawSolData.tokenAmount),
>>>         uint64(_withdrawSolData.fee),
            uint64(_withdrawSolData.chainId),
            uint64(_withdrawSolData.withdrawNonce)
        );
    }
```

This fee is then deducted from the amount to be received by the receiver

```rust
    pub fn apply(ctx: &mut Context<OAppLzReceive>, params: &OAppLzReceiveParams) -> Result<()> {
        let seeds: &[&[u8]] = &[OAPP_SEED, &[ctx.accounts.oapp_config.bump]];
//  ...

            // msg!("Withdraw amount = {}", withdraw_params.token_amount);
>>>         let amount_to_transfer = withdraw_params.token_amount - withdraw_params.fee;
            transfer(
                ctx.accounts
                    .transfer_token_ctx()
                    .with_signer(&[&vault_authority_seeds[..]]),
                amount_to_transfer,
            )?;

// ...
    }
}
```

These fees however will remain stuck in the contract as there is no definitive function for withdrawing or getting them out of the protocol. This can be observed going through the contracts.

### Internal pre-conditions
 _No response_
 
### External pre-conditions
 _No response_
 
### Attack Path

### Impact

Loss of fees due to no way to retrieve them.
 
### PoC
 _No response_
 
### Mitigation

Add a function to withdraw fees in the solana contracts
