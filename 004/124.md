# Fees is not tabulated properly in oapp_lz_receive.rs

### Summary

In [`oapp_lz_receive.rs`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-09-orderly-network-solana-contract/blob/main/solana-vault/packages/solana/contracts/programs/solana-vault/src/instructions/oapp_instr/oapp_lz_receive.rs#L117), the fees is calculated through the withdraw params, and is deducted from the actual token amount to be transferred to the user. `amount_to_transfer = withdraw_params.token_amount - withdraw_params.fee;`

This leaves the fee amount in the `vault_deposit_wallet`. With many messages that are being received, `vault_deposit_wallet` will not know how much fees are collected.

### Root Cause

In oapp_lz_receive, the actual amount to transfer to the user is the amount minus fees.

```rust
         // msg!("Withdraw amount = {}", withdraw_params.token_amount);
 >          let amount_to_transfer = withdraw_params.token_amount - withdraw_params.fee;
            transfer(
                ctx.accounts
                    .transfer_token_ctx()
                    .with_signer(&[&vault_authority_seeds[..]]),
                amount_to_transfer,
            )?;

```

`transfer_token_ctx` transfers funds from the `vault_deposit_wallet` to the `user_deposit_wallet`, which means that `vault_deposit_wallet` holds both the funds and the fees.

```rust
  fn transfer_token_ctx(&self) -> CpiContext<'_, '_, '_, 'info, Transfer<'info>> {
        let cpi_accounts = Transfer {
            from: self.vault_deposit_wallet.to_account_info(),
            to: self.user_deposit_wallet.to_account_info(),
            authority: self.vault_authority.to_account_info(),
        };
        let cpi_program = self.token_program.to_account_info();
        CpiContext::new(cpi_program, cpi_accounts)
    }
```

The fees is left in the `vault_deposit_wallet` account, but it is not stored as a value.

`vault_deposit_wallet` account owner will not know the actual amount of fees being collected.

_No response_

### External pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

_No response_

### Impact

Fees are not calculated and tabulated, the owner will not know how much fees is collected at any point in time.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Have another variable that tracks the fees amount for every message received.
