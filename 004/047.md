# Solana program lack function to cailm withdraw fee

### Summary

The Solana program charges a fee from USDC withdrawal requests, but there is no function to collect the withdrawal fee, which results in all fees being stuck in the contract and unable to be withdrawn.

```rust
            // msg!("Withdraw amount = {}", withdraw_params.token_amount);
            let amount_to_transfer = withdraw_params.token_amount - withdraw_params.fee;
            transfer(
                ctx.accounts
                    .transfer_token_ctx()
                    .with_signer(&[&vault_authority_seeds[..]]),
                amount_to_transfer,
            )?;

```
