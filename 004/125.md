# The Vault contract on the Solana side lacks a method for withdrawing fees.

### Summary

The Vault contract on the Solana side lacks a method for withdrawing fees.

### Root Cause

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-09-orderly-network-solana-contract/blob/main/solana-vault/packages/solana/contracts/programs/solana-vault/src/instructions/oapp_instr/oapp_lz_receive.rs#L75C3-L123C16
```rust
 pub fn apply(ctx: &mut Context<OAppLzReceive>, params: &OAppLzReceiveParams) -> Result<()> {
        //---skip
        let lz_message = LzMessage::decode(&params.message).unwrap();
        msg!("msg_type: {:?}", lz_message.msg_type);
        if lz_message.msg_type == MsgType::Withdraw as u8 {
            let withdraw_params = AccountWithdrawSol::decode_packed(&lz_message.payload).unwrap();

            let vault_authority_seeds =
                &[VAULT_AUTHORITY_SEED, &[ctx.accounts.vault_authority.bump]];

            // msg!("Withdraw amount = {}", withdraw_params.token_amount);
@>>            let amount_to_transfer = withdraw_params.token_amount - withdraw_params.fee;
            transfer(
                ctx.accounts
                    .transfer_token_ctx()
                    .with_signer(&[&vault_authority_seeds[..]]),
                amount_to_transfer,
            )?;
        }
 }
```
It can be seen that the number of tokens transferred to the user is amount_to_transfer, which excludes the withdraw_params.fee portion. As a result, the fee remains in the Vault contract.

However, after reviewing all the interfaces in Vault contract (in lib.rs), itâ€™s evident that there is no method for withdrawing the fee, which will lead to the fee being stuck in the protocol.

### Internal pre-conditions

_No response_

### External pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

_No response_

### Impact

There is no method for withdrawing the fee, which will lead to the fee being stuck in the protocol.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Add a method in the Vault contract that allows the administrator to withdraw the accumulated fees.
