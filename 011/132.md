# SolConnector is not allowed to call `accountDeposit()` on the Ledger

### Summary

SolConnector calls [`ledger.accountDeposit()`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-09-orderly-network-solana-contract/blob/main/sol-cc/contracts/SolConnector.sol#L68-L69) when it receives an LZ message. However, only the `CrossChainManager` can access [`accountDeposit()`](https://github.com/OrderlyNetwork/contract-evm/blob/main/src/Ledger.sol#L226).

### Root Cause

The `onlyCrossChainManager` check in [`Ledger.accountDeposit()`](https://github.com/OrderlyNetwork/contract-evm/blob/main/src/Ledger.sol#L226) prevents the SolConnector from calling it.

### Internal pre-conditions

_No response_

### External pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

1. When `lzReceive()` is called on SolConnector to process a deposit, it will always revert due to the call to `ledger.accountDeposit()` reverting from lack of access.

### Impact

SolConnector can not process all deposits until the issue has been fixed.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Consider allowing `SolConnector` access to Ledger's `accountDeposit()`.
