# `_refundAddress` is not set for sender (payer) but is set for `SolConnector.sol` contract, this causes the sender (payer) not to receive the excess fee and anyone can use the excess fee to pay for his transactions

### Summary

In the `_lzSend()` function there is a `_refundAddress` variable which functions to store the address to return the excess fee used to send messages. The address stored in this variable should be the sender (payer) because the sender (payer) makes the fee payment from the source chain, but in fact it is not. `_refundAddress` here stores the `SolConnector` address as the destination address for sending the excess fee. 

This causes the sender (payer) not to receive the excess fee and anyone can use the excess fee to pay for his transactions.

The main reason why anyone can use the excess fee because the excess fee from each existing transaction will be stored in the `SolConnector.sol` contract and the `_lzSend()` function will only revert if `msg.value` < `_nativeFee` **AND** the `_nativeFee` balance on `SolConnector` contract < minimum `_nativeFee` for a transaction, as the code below :

```solidity
if (msg.value < _nativeFee && address(this).balance < _nativeFee) revert NotEnoughNative(msg.value);
```

That way, anyone can make free transactions if the `nativeFee` balance on the `SolConnector` contract is more than the minimum `_nativeFee`.

### Root Cause

*In [SolConnector:97](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-09-orderly-network-solana-contract/blob/main/sol-cc/contracts/SolConnector.sol#L97) `address(this)` set into `_refundAddress` variable*
