# Unchecked Indexing Vulnerability (Out-of-Bounds Access Bug) will leads to Potential Service Disruption & Unpredictable Crashes

## Summary

The VaultDepositParams::decode function accesses slices of the input array without checking if the indices are within bounds. This can lead to an out-of-bounds access, potentially causing:
Runtime errors (panic/abort) And Data corruption.

## Vulnerability Detail

The VaultDepositParams::decode function contains an unchecked indexing vulnerability, where it accesses slices of the input array without verifying if the indices (offset) are within bounds. This potentially leads to out-of-bounds access, causing runtime errors and data corruption.

## Proof of Concept 

## Impact 

Unpredictable crashes and data corruption due to uncontrolled memory access.

## Code Snippet

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-09-orderly-network-solana-contract/blob/main/solana-vault/packages/solana/contracts/programs/solana-vault/src/instructions/msg_codec.rs#L26-L29

## Tool used 
Manual Review 

## Recommendation 

Implement bounds checking for indexing operations in VaultDepositParams::decode to prevent out-of-bounds access.

Replace:


let account_id = input[offset..offset + 32].try_into().unwrap();


With:


if offset + 32 <= input.len() {
    let account_id = &input[offset..offset + 32];
    // Process account_id
} else {
    // Handle error: out-of-bounds access
}


OR using Rust safe indexing:


let account_id = input.get(offset..offset + 32).ok_or("Out-of-bounds access")?;


This ensures safe and explicit bounds checking preventing potential crashes and data corruption.
