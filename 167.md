# Missing Conditional Registration for New LayerZero Endpoint on OApp Reinitialization May Cause Call Failures

### Summary

The OApp reinitialization process lacks a conditional registration for newly configured LayerZero endpoints, leading to potential call failures if a new endpoint is specified. The LayerZero endpoint should only be registered once, but if reinitialization configures a new endpoint, registration does not occur, causing calls to fail due to the endpointâ€™s unregistered status.

### Root Cause

During OApp reinitialization, there is no check to register a new LayerZero endpoint if the configuration has changed. The initial setup registers the endpoint correctly, but reinitialization does not trigger registration if a different endpoint is introduced.

xample:

In LayerZero's example implementation, endpoint registration occurs during initial setup, ensuring valid communication paths. The OApp, however, does not re-register if a new endpoint is added during reinitialization, leaving it unverified and potentially inactive.

### Internal pre-conditions

- The OApp undergoes reinitialization with a new LayerZero endpoint configured.
- The reinitialization process does not trigger conditional registration for the new endpoint

### External pre-conditions

- The user reinitializes the OApp and configures a different LayerZero endpoint from the original.
- There is no external mechanism to enforce registration of this newly configured endpoint.

### Attack Path

- The OApp is reinitialized, and a new LayerZero endpoint is configured without triggering registration.
- Calls to LayerZero fail due to the unregistered status of the newly added endpoint, impacting OApp functionality.

### Impact

The OApp may experience disruptions as calls to an unregistered, newly configured LayerZero endpoint fail. This missing conditional registration step for new endpoints affects cross-chain communication, leading to potential call failures and limited protocol usability.
