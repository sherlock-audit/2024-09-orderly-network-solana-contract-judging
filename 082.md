# users lose their assets if their withdraw token amount be greater than uint64.max

### Summary

users lose their assets if their withdraw token amount be greater than uint64.max

### Root Cause

users should request withdraw siguature for withdraw their assets and they can specify the token amount to withdraw and based [AccountWithdrawSol](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-09-orderly-network-solana-contract/blob/main/sol-cc/contracts/interface/ILedger.sol#L23) max value for token amount is uint128.max and after that withdraw will be called by ledger to execute withdrawal requests and as we can see withdrawal request will be [encoded by MsgCodec](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-09-orderly-network-solana-contract/blob/main/sol-cc/contracts/SolConnector.sol#L90) and in encodeWithdrawPayload function [token amount will be typecasted to uint64](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-09-orderly-network-solana-contract/blob/main/sol-cc/contracts/library/MsgCodec.sol#L25) its mean if token amount be greater than uint64 they get less token in sol network from expected also we can see there is another wrong typecasting for fee and chain id

### Impact

users get less token in destination network
