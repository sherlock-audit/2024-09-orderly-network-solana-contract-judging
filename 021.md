# Peers cannot be changed on solana if needed


### Summary
Peers cannot be changed on solana while it can be changed on orderly. This is becaused `set_peer` will not work after initial setting of peer as its implementaion is set to not be writable.

### Root Cause

When the lz types status are encoded, the peer pubkey's `is_writable` status is set as falsed

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-09-orderly-network-solana-contract/blob/02396b61f6e77008d8d24c8b84f65644b20f445e/solana-vault/packages/solana/contracts/programs/solana-vault/src/instructions/oapp_instr/oapp_lz_receive_types.rs#L48-L58

```rust
impl OAppLzReceiveTypes<'_> {
//...
            LzAccount {
                pubkey: peer,
                is_signer: false,
                is_writable: false,
            }, // 1
        ];

```

So after the peer has been initially set, changing it will be impossible

As a result, when the [functions](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-09-orderly-network-solana-contract/blob/02396b61f6e77008d8d24c8b84f65644b20f445e/solana-vault/packages/solana/contracts/programs/solana-vault/src/instructions/oapp_instr/set_peer.rs#L27-L34) to `set_peer` is called, they'll fail. 

```rust
impl SetPeer<'_> {
    pub fn apply(ctx: &mut Context<SetPeer>, params: &SetPeerParams) -> Result<()> {
        ctx.accounts.peer.address = params.peer;
        ctx.accounts.peer.bump = ctx.bumps.peer;
        Ok(())
    }
}
```
This can also lead to issues if peer is changed on orderly's [oapp](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-09-orderly-network-solana-contract/blob/02396b61f6e77008d8d24c8b84f65644b20f445e/sol-cc/contracts/layerzerolabs/lz-evm-oapp-v2/contracts/oapp/OAppCoreUpgradeable.sol#L47), as it implemenation is not immutable.
