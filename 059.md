# Reentrancy Protection

### Summary

I would like to consider adding reentrancy protection (nonReentrant) to functions that involve withdrawals or direct transfers (although onlyLedger minimizes external call risk). Since you're using upgradeable contracts and external calls are made, this could help prevent reentrancy attacks in the future.
