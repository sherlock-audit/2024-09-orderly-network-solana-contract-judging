# Improper closing/resetting of OAppconfig Account

### Summary

The audit of the `ResetOApp` struct in the Solana Vault project revealed that the current implementation lacks a closing constraint for the `oapp_config` account. This oversight poses risks of resource leaks and potential security vulnerabilities, as open accounts can consume resources unnecessarily and may be exposed to unauthorized access.

### Root Cause

1. Lack of Awareness of Security Best Practices: The developer may not have been fully aware of the security implications associated with not using the close constraint. The close constraint automatically handles the transfer of lamports, zeroes out the account data, and sets the account discriminator to the CLOSED_ACCOUNT_DISCRIMINATOR, which is crucial for preventing revival attacks.

 2. Manual Account Management: The current implementation manually assigns the system_program::ID to the oapp_config account and reallocates it to zero. This approach does not ensure that the account is properly closed and can leave the account in a state that is vulnerable to exploitation. The manual process is error-prone and does not follow the recommended practices outlined in the Anchor documentation.

### Impact

Failing to transfer existing lamports during account closure in the Solana blockchain can have several significant impacts. Firstly, it leads to resource waste, as the account remains open and continues to consume network resources, resulting in unnecessary costs for both the program and the user.

 Additionally, this oversight can create security vulnerabilities; an attacker could exploit the account by keeping it alive through lamport refunds, allowing for repeated exploitation and potential financial losses. The lack of proper lamport transfer also increases the complexity of account management, requiring developers to implement additional logic to handle accounts that should be closed but are not, which can introduce bugs or vulnerabilities. 

Furthermore, users may experience confusion or frustration if accounts that should be closed remain active, leading to misunderstandings about their account states and resource consumption. Lastly, not adhering to best practices for account management can result in compliance issues, particularly in regulated environments. Therefore, it is essential to implement the #[account(close = <target_account>)] constraint in Anchor to ensure that lamports are transferred, account data is zeroed out, and the account is marked as closed, thereby mitigating these risks. For more information on secure account closing practices, refer to the Solana documentation on closing accounts.

### Mitigation

```diff
#[derive(Accounts)]
pub struct ResetOApp<'info> {
    #[account(mut)]
    pub admin: Signer<'info>,
    #[account(
        mut,
+        close = admin,
        seeds = [OAPP_SEED],
        bump = oapp_config.bump,
        has_one = admin @ OAppError::Unauthorized
    )]
    pub oapp_config: Account<'info, OAppConfig>,
}
```
In the implementation itself : 
```diff
impl ResetOApp<'_> {
    pub fn apply(ctx: &mut Context<ResetOApp>) -> Result<()> {
-        let oapp_config_account_info = &mut ctx.accounts.oapp_config.to_account_info();
-       oapp_config_account_info.assign(&system_program::ID);
-       oapp_config_account_info.realloc(0, false)?;
        msg!("Reset OApp");
        Ok(())
    }
}
```
