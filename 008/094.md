# Issue with Closing the Account on solana

### Summary

The code doesn’t properly close the account and handle the lamports stored in it.

### Root Cause

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-09-orderly-network-solana-contract/blob/main/solana-vault/packages/solana/contracts/programs/solana-vault/src/instructions/oapp_instr/reset_oapp.rs#L20
```rust
impl ResetOApp<'_> {
    pub fn apply(ctx: &mut Context<ResetOApp>) -> Result<()> {
        let oapp_config_account_info = &mut ctx.accounts.oapp_config.to_account_info();
@>>        oapp_config_account_info.assign(&system_program::ID);
@>>        oapp_config_account_info.realloc(0, false)?;
        msg!("Reset OApp");
        Ok(())
    }
}
```

```rust
impl ResetVault<'_> {
    pub fn apply(ctx: &mut Context<ResetVault>) -> Result<()> {
        let vault_authority = &mut ctx.accounts.vault_authority.to_account_info();
@>>        vault_authority.assign(&system_program::ID);
@>>        vault_authority.realloc(0, false)?;
        msg!("Reset OApp");
        Ok(())
    }
}
```
we can see that instructions for  Closing the Account in ResetOApp and ResetVault. 
•	The code doesn’t properly close the account or handle the lamports stored in it.
•	Simply reallocating the account’s data to zero and changing its owner doesn’t free up the storage or reclaim the lamports.
•	The account will remain in storage with its lamports locked, leading to potential resource leaks.

And there are Issues with reassigning the owner.
In Solana, an account’s owner can only be changed if the account is currently owned by the system program.

### Impact

The account will remain in storage with its lamports locked, leading to potential resource leaks.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

•	Use the close attribute in the account’s struct to specify where the lamports should be transferred upon closing.
•	Modify the ResetOApp struct to include the close attribute, pointing to the admin account.
•	Remove the manual assignment and reallocation logic from the apply function, as Anchor will handle the account closure automatically.
Like code below:
```rust
  #[derive(Accounts)]
  pub struct ResetOApp<'info> {
      #[account(mut)]
      pub admin: Signer<'info>,
      #[account(
          mut,
          seeds = [OAPP_SEED],
          bump = oapp_config.bump,
          has_one = admin @ OAppError::Unauthorized,
          close = admin
      )]
      pub oapp_config: Account<'info, OAppConfig>,
  }
  
  impl ResetOApp<'_> {
      pub fn apply(ctx: &mut Context<ResetOApp>) -> Result<()> {
          msg!("Reset OApp");
          Ok(())
      }
  }
```
