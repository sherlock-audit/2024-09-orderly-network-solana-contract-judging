# The withdraw function lacks the payable and parameter validation.

### Summary

Due to the lack of a payable feature in the withdraw function, users cannot pay the gas fee in a single call. They must first send the fee to the SolConnector contract and then call withdraw.

If the cross-chain fees are provided by the protocol, not checking the parameter length could allow a malicious caller to continuously deplete the cross-chain fees.

### Root Cause

1. The withdraw function is missing the payable modifier.

```solidity
function withdraw(WithdrawDataSol calldata _withdrawData) external onlyLedger {
```
2. The withdraw function lacks parameter validation.
```solidity
    function withdraw(WithdrawDataSol calldata _withdrawData) external onlyLedger {
        AccountWithdrawSol memory withdrawData = AccountWithdrawSol(
            Utils.getSolAccountId(_withdrawData.sender, _withdrawData.brokerId),
            _withdrawData.sender,
            _withdrawData.receiver,
@>           Utils.calculateStringHash(_withdrawData.brokerId),
@>           Utils.calculateStringHash(_withdrawData.tokenSymbol),
            _withdrawData.tokenAmount,
            _withdrawData.fee,
            _withdrawData.chainId,
            _withdrawData.withdrawNonce
        );
```

### Attack Path

1. When the cross-chain fees are provided by the project team, A large protocol fee is being provided. In test is 1 ether
2. Malicious users can deplete the gas fees by passing in a long brokerId or tokenSymbol.

1. When a user transfers cross-chain transaction fees in a single transaction.
2. Malicious users can front-run and deplete the cross-chain fees.

### Impact

When the cross-chain fees are provided by the project team, malicious actors can deplete the cross-chain fees continuously through a single transaction.
When a user transfers cross-chain transaction fees in a single transaction, malicious users can front-run and deplete the cross-chain fees.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Add the payable and parameter length validation to the withdraw function.
