# `oapp_quote` Always Applies `Send-and-Call` Option, Leading to Higher Fee Estimates


### Summary
The [`solana_vault::oapp_quote`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-09-orderly-network-solana-contract/blob/a40ed80ce4a196bc81bfa6dfb749c19b92c623b0/solana-vault/packages/solana/contracts/programs/solana-vault/src/lib.rs#L65-L67) function incorrectly uses the message to be sent, as a composed message, resulting in the `send and call` option always being applied.

### Root Cause
The [`solana_vault::oapp_quote`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-09-orderly-network-solana-contract/blob/a40ed80ce4a196bc81bfa6dfb749c19b92c623b0/solana-vault/packages/solana/contracts/programs/solana-vault/src/lib.rs#L65-L67) function is designed to allow depositors to simulate a LayerZero send transaction to determine their fee obligations to LayerZero. There are currently two types of options: one for a normal send and another for sending and calling (i.e. when there is a composed message). 

The Solana vault does not currently send any composed messages during deposits, as messages are only sent to `SolConnector` with no additional calls. As a result, the enforced option for `send_and_call` is typically not set; if it is set, it would require more gas than normal send messages. However, when determining the combined option based on the presence of a composed message, the system incorrectly uses the message to be sent as the composed message:
```rust
                    .enforced_options
                    .combine_options(&params.message, &params.options)?,
```
This always applies the `send_and_call` option when getting a quote, as the message is not empty:
```rust
    pub fn combine_options(
        &self,
        compose_msg: &Option<Vec<u8>>,
        extra_options: &Vec<u8>,
    ) -> Result<Vec<u8>> {
        let enforced_options = if compose_msg.is_none() { // <---@
            self.send.clone()
        } else {
            self.send_and_call.clone()
        };
        oapp::options::combine_options(enforced_options, extra_options)
    }
```
This causes the [`solana_vault::oapp_quote`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-09-orderly-network-solana-contract/blob/a40ed80ce4a196bc81bfa6dfb749c19b92c623b0/solana-vault/packages/solana/contracts/programs/solana-vault/src/lib.rs#L65-L67) function to always return inaccurate LayerZero fees.

### Internal Preconditions
None

### External Preconditions
None

### Attack Path
None

### Impact
Depositors receive inflated LayerZero fee estimates, potentially deterring transactions and misrepresenting actual costs.

### Proof of Concept (PoC)
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-09-orderly-network-solana-contract/blob/a40ed80ce4a196bc81bfa6dfb749c19b92c623b0/solana-vault/packages/solana/contracts/programs/solana-vault/src/lib.rs#L65-L67
### Mitigation
Just as done [here](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-09-orderly-network-solana-contract/blob/a40ed80ce4a196bc81bfa6dfb749c19b92c623b0/solana-vault/packages/solana/contracts/programs/solana-vault/src/instructions/vault_instr/deposit.rs#L141), the composed message argument should be None. Update [here](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-09-orderly-network-solana-contract/blob/a40ed80ce4a196bc81bfa6dfb749c19b92c623b0/solana-vault/packages/solana/contracts/programs/solana-vault/src/instructions/oapp_instr/oapp_quote.rs#L48-L49) to:
```rust
                    .enforced_options
                    .combine_options(&None, &params.options)?,
```
