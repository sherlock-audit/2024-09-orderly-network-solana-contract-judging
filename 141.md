# Native fee cannot be paid because the `withdraw` function is not payable

### Summary

The `_nativeFee` is paid in Ether and it is expected the Ether to be passed to the `withdraw ` function, however the function is not payable, which prevents it from receiving Ether (msg.value). This limitation impacts the function's ability to transfer funds to pay required messaging fees and will make the transaction revert. 



### Root Cause

The [_lzSend](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-09-orderly-network-solana-contract/blob/a40ed80ce4a196bc81bfa6dfb749c19b92c623b0/sol-cc/contracts/layerzerolabs/lz-evm-oapp-v2/contracts/oapp/OAppSenderUpgradeable.sol#L80-L97) function, invoked within `withdraw`, requires Ether to pay the native messaging fee. This fee is determined within [_payNative](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-09-orderly-network-solana-contract/blob/a40ed80ce4a196bc81bfa6dfb749c19b92c623b0/sol-cc/contracts/layerzerolabs/lz-evm-oapp-v2/contracts/oapp/OAppSenderUpgradeable.sol#L110-L114), which verifies that either msg.value or the contractâ€™s balance is sufficient to cover `_nativeFee`. Since withdraw lacks the payable modifier, the caller cannot set msg.value.

### Impact

When the contract's balance is insufficient, `_nativeFee` cannot be paid because the `withdraw` function is not payable.
