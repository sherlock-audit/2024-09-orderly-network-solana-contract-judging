# No way to withdraw any refunds left in SolConnector

### Summary

Excess left in SolConnector after its last call will be irretrivable.

### Root Cause

The withdraw function is not payable, so ETH has to be sent the contract before any calls can be made through its receive/fallback functions. This ETH is then forwarded through the `_lzSend` call to the endpoint.

```solidity
    function withdraw(WithdrawDataSol calldata _withdrawData) external onlyLedger {
// ....
        MessagingFee memory _msgFee = _quote(solEid, lzWithdrawMsg, withdrawOptions, false);
        _lzSend(solEid, lzWithdrawMsg, withdrawOptions, _msgFee, address(this));
    }
```

```solidity
    fallback() external payable {}

    receive() external payable {}
```

Now, due to the variable nature of the endpoints fee calculations, it's almost impossible to predict the exact amount of tokens that'll be needed to send a message. Even using `_quote` is subject to refunds as the fee is an estimate which in a lot of cases is more than enough, as a result ETH must always be provided to the contract. These refunds are also processed by sending it back to the contract as `address(this)` is specified as receiver. What this means is that, there'll always be excess tokens, which although can be used for future calls, and are not retrievable, so at a point in time, when the contract is to be used for its last set of calls (e.g contract retirement, migration, etc), the remaining ETH in the contract will still be left, and will remain irretrievable.

### External pre-conditions

### Attack Path

### Impact
 
After the last set of calls, whatever ETH is left cannot be retrived, leading to loss of funds. 
 
### PoC
 _No response_
 
### Mitigation

Add an admin function recover any excess tokens from the contract.
