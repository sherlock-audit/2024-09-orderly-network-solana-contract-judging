# Denial of Service (DoS) via Excessive Gas Consumption

### Summary

The combineOptions function allows users to provide additional options (_extraOptions) that are combined with enforced options (enforcedOptions). The code checks if _extraOptions.length >= 2 and assumes that if it is, the options are of type 3. However, this check is insufficient.

### Root Cause

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-09-orderly-network-solana-contract/blob/main/sol-cc/contracts/layerzerolabs/lz-evm-oapp-v2/contracts/oapp/libs/OAppOptionsType3Upgradeable.sol#L69C1-L91C6
```solidity
function combineOptions(
    uint32 _eid,
    uint16 _msgType,
    bytes calldata _extraOptions
) public view virtual returns (bytes memory) {
    // ...

    if (_extraOptions.length >= 2) {
        _assertOptionsType3(_extraOptions);
        // @dev Remove the first 2 bytes containing the type from the _extraOptions and combine with enforced.
        return bytes.concat(enforced, _extraOptions[2:]);
    }

    // ...
}

```
An attacker could craft a malicious _extraOptions array that is very large but doesn't actually conform to the type 3 options format. The bytes.concat operation would then combine this massive array with the enforced options, creating a huge byte array in memory. This could consume excessive gas during subsequent processing, potentially exceeding the block gas limit and causing a DoS.

### Attack Path

Attack Scenario

1. Crafting the Payload: The attacker crafts a bytes calldata _extraOptions array that is intentionally very large. Crucially, this array does not conform to the expected type 3 options format. It might just be filled with arbitrary data.

2. Calling combineOptions: The attacker calls the combineOptions function on the OAppOptionsType3Upgradeable contract, providing the malicious _extraOptions array.

3. Bypassing the Check: The if (_extraOptions.length >= 2) check passes because the attacker's array is indeed large. However, the _assertOptionsType3(_extraOptions) check, which is supposed to validate the format, only examines the first two bytes for the option type. It doesn't verify the structure of the rest of the array.

4. Excessive Gas Consumption: The bytes.concat(enforced, _extraOptions[2:]) operation combines the attacker's massive array with the enforced options, creating a huge byte array in memory. This consumes a significant amount of gas.

- Direct Gas Exhaustion: If the gas consumed by bytes.concat exceeds the attacker's gas limit or the block gas limit, the transaction will revert, wasting the attacker's gas but not directly affecting other users.
- Indirect DoS: If the combined byte array is subsequently used in another function, such as _lzSend for cross-chain messaging, the gas cost of processing this large array could exceed the block gas limit. This would prevent other transactions from being included in the block, causing a denial of service for other users of the network.

### Mitigation

```solidity 
    function combineOptions(
        uint32 _eid,
        uint16 _msgType,
        bytes calldata _extraOptions
    ) public view virtual returns (bytes memory) {
        bytes memory enforced = enforcedOptions[_eid][_msgType];

        // No enforced options, pass whatever the caller supplied, even if it's empty or legacy type 1/2 options.
        if (enforced.length == 0) return _extraOptions;

        // No caller options, return enforced
        if (_extraOptions.length == 0) return enforced;

        // @dev If caller provided _extraOptions, must be type 3 as its the ONLY type that can be combined.
        if (_extraOptions.length >= 2) {
            _assertOptionsType3(_extraOptions);

            // Mitigation: Limit the combined size
+           uint256 combinedSize = enforced.length + _extraOptions.length - 2;
+           require(combinedSize <= MAX_COMBINED_OPTIONS_SIZE, "Combined options size exceeds limit");

            // @dev Remove the first 2 bytes containing the type from the _extraOptions and combine with enforced.
            return bytes.concat(enforced, _extraOptions[2:]);
        }

        // No valid set of options was found.
        revert InvalidOptions(_extraOptions);
    }

    // ... (other functions) ...

    // Add a constant for the maximum combined options size
    uint256 public constant MAX_COMBINED_OPTIONS_SIZE = 4096; // Example limit, adjust as needed
}

```

By limiting the maximum size of the combined options, we prevent attackers from crafting malicious _extraOptions that could lead to excessive gas consumption.
The require statement ensures that the combined size stays within a safe limit, preventing potential DoS attacks.
