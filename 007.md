# Improper reseting of the vault

### Summary

 The current implementation of the ResetVault struct in reset_vault.rs lacks the close=owner constraint for the vault_authority account. In the current design, the ownership of the vault_authority account is transferred to the system program, and the account is reallocated with a size of 0. However, this approach fails to account for the lamports remaining in the Program Derived Address (PDA), leading to a situation where these funds are effectively locked and inaccessible.

### Root Cause

Lack of close=owner Constraint:

The ResetVault instruction does not use the close=owner constraint on the vault_authority account.
In Solana programs, when an account is closed, any remaining lamports in the account are transferred to the specified recipient (in this case, the owner). However, since the close constraint is missing, the lamports stored in the vault_authority account are not transferred back to the owner.

### Impact

When the vault_authority account is reset or closed, any remaining lamports within the PDA are not transferred back to the owner. This results in a potential loss of funds, as these lamports become stuck in an address that is no longer managed by the program. This oversight compromises the security and efficiency of the program by not ensuring proper fund management during the account closure process.

### PoC

1. User initializes a vault and spends some lamports to create the account
2. User decides to reset the account
3. Concerned User calls the `reset_vault` , though the account size is initialized to zero and ownership is transferred, lamports are still stuck in there


### Mitigation

```diff
 #[account(
        mut, 
+       close = owner,  // Added line to close the account and transfer remaining balance to owner
        seeds = [VAULT_AUTHORITY_SEED],
        bump = vault_authority.bump,
        has_one = owner @ VaultError::InvalidVaultOwner
    )]
```
