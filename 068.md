# Attacker can DoS the withdrawals by initializing the vault authority account after owner resets it

### Summary

The `solana_vault::reset_vault` function works by completely closing the account:
- Assigns the account ownership to the  System program.
- Sets the length of account data to zero.

After the instruction, the `vault_authority` PDA becomes a new uninitialized and empty account owned by the System program. Because `init_vault` function is not protected, an attacker can initialize the `vault_authority` with their own parameters and DoS the `solana_vault` application preventing withdrawals and deposits.


Code Snippets:

`ResetVault` instruction completely closing the `vault_authority` PDA:

Unprotected `InitVault` instruction allowing anyone to call and initialize the vault authority account:

Note the `solana_vault::reset_oapp` has the same behavior: It completely closes the `oapp_config` PDA. However, this vulnerability does not impact that instance as the `init_oapp` function will also try to initialize a second account (`lz_receive_types`) and it will fail the transaction. Attacker cannot call `init_oapp`.

### Root Cause

Resetting the vault by completely closing the account instead of using a `flag` variable or setting the values to `0`.

### Internal pre-conditions

1. `vault_authority.owner` resets the `vault_authority` PDA

### External pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

1. `vault_authority.owner` resets the `vault_authority` PDA.
2. Eve, an attacker, calls `init_vault` instruction using the following arguments:
- owner: Eve's account
- order_delivery: true
- dst_eid: 0 or any non-existent eid
- sol_chain_id: 0

The `init_vault ` sets the `vault_authority` values to the given arguments. The `vault_authority.inbound_nonce` and `vault_authority.deposit_nonce` are both set by default to `0`.

Users cannot perform deposits because of incorrect `dst_eid`. The withdrawal process requires the execution of `solana_vault::lz_receive` function. It checks the `vault_authority.inbound_nonce` if the `vault_authority.order_delivery` is set to `true`:

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-09-orderly-network-solana-contract/blob/main/solana-vault/packages/solana/contracts/programs/solana-vault/src/instructions/oapp_instr/oapp_lz_receive.rs#L94-L101

Attacker sets the `order_delivery` to true and `inbound_nonce` to `0`. As a result, the `lz_receive` function fails with `InvalidInboundNonce` error disallowing all token withdrawals. The tokens will get stuck in the `vault_authority` token account.


The `SetOrderDelivery` instruction allows the `vault_authority.owner` to update the `order_delivery` and `inbound_nonce`. Hence, attacker controls whether to allow for withdrawals or not.

### Impact

Complete DoS of deposits and withdrawals from `solana_vault`. All USDC tokens in the `vault_authority` token account get stuck and the attacker controls whether to allow for withdrawals or not.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Add a `resetted` flag variable in the `vault_authority` and set it to true in the `reset_vault` function. Use this variable in all the functions to allow operations only when its false.
