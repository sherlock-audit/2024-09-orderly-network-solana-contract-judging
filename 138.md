# Malicious Users can Disable Rate limiting Leading to Dos and Unauthorized Access.

## Summary

The SetRateLimit instruction does not validate the SetRateLimitParams struct.


## Vulnerability Detail

The SetRateLimit instruction uses the SetRateLimitParams struct without validating its fields. This allows an attacker to set arbitrary rate limits, potentially leading to unauthorized access or denial-of-service attack.

## Proof of Concept

## Impact
Unvalidated rate limit parameters will enable attackers to:

- Set excessively high rate limits, causing network congestion.
- Set excessively low rate limits, denying legitimate access.

## Tool used
Manual Review

## Recommendation

1. Validate dst_eid to ensure it matches expected formats.
2. Validate rate limit values to prevent excessive or insufficient limits.
